There were a lot of technical issues with the global sessions. Some were on our side (audio/video sync, which we finally solved) but most were on the presenters side.

OTHER COMMENTS
* The global broadcasts were disappointing because of technical difficulties. Of the four we tried to watch/participate in, only the first one was even legible.  The second one seemed to be cancelled but there no notices of this; the mopad existed, as did the google hangout, but it was not active.  The listing disappeared from the list without explanation. I understand a cancellation but a notice on the schedule (not just a deletion) would help.  Question: did presenters/speakers have time to test out their set up in advance?  We experienced video issues, audio issues, audio delays, etc.  We were not able to see the 3rd and 4th presentations we intended to see.

I was surprised to find a very small group of people at the London retreat. I somehow expected more people to be interested and to participate.
It was great to meet a number of other instructors, specifically in the light of future invites to teach in SA.
