The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/), a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit based in California, USA. The Carpentries is [transitioning out of fiscal sponsorship to an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation](https://carpentries.org/files/pdf/Fiscal_Sponsorship_Transition_FAQ.pdf). For that reason, the organisation has two governing bodies: an Advisory Committee and a Board of Directors.

Governance of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives) is undertaken by a three-person Advisory Committee.

## Roles and Responsibilities of the Advisory Committee

Every fiscally sponsored project (FSP) must maintain an Advisory Committee of three or more persons that meets a minimum of once per year and provides its minutes to Community Initiatives upon request along with the FSP's annual budget. No more than 49 percent of the members of each Advisory Committee may be paid. Each FSP must maintain a current listing of the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of all members of its Advisory Committee and notify Community Initiatives when changes occur.

The Advisory Committee must, at minimum, assume the following joint responsibilities:

*   Sign the fiscal sponsorship agreement
*   Hire, supervise, and terminate, when necessary, the FSP's Project Director (Executive Director)
*   Approve reimbursement requests for Project Director and fellow Advisory Committee Members.
