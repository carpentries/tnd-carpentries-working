## Introduction

The Carpentries is a mission-driven nonprofit project that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are often not included as a part of basic research training in many disciplines. Our global community works together to provide:

- A suite of open source, collaboratively-built, community-developed lessons
- Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training
- Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach
- A supportive learning culture
- A global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct


## Our vision

Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

## Our mission

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.

## Our Work

The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are held together by a small Core Team, but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities. The global Carpentries community consists of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Member Organisations, committee or task force members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share.

## Lesson Programs

The Carpentries has three official lesson programs, each providing lessons catered to a specific audience or purpose. Our workshops may focus on lessons from one set of curricula or mix and match lesson's to provide the audience with an experience catered to their needs.

<td>Data Carpentry lessons are domain-specific (include examples from their type of work). Learn how to use code to work more effectively and reproducibly with data with lessons based in Astronomy, Ecology, Genomics, Image Processing and Social Sciences.</td>
<td>Library Carpentry lessons are domain-agnostic, and teach OpenRefine, Git, SQL, R, Python, and more. Exercises include datasets that will be familiar to librarians.</td>
<td>Software Carpentry lessons are domain-agnostic, and teach the Unix shell, coding in R or Python, and version control using Git. Exercises are generic and for anyone wanting to be more comfortable with coding.

## Our History

We have a rich history that dates back to 1998 when Software Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing. At that time, Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda taught workshops to teach researchers software development skills. Greg continued this work, building a collection of collaboratively-developed and openly-available lessons, as well as community of instructors who used those lessons to teach workshops.

In 2014, Data Carpentry was founded with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy. Also in 2014, Library Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles. Each organisation working in tandem and in partnership to develop lessons and build global communities of practice.

In 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form a new project called The Carpentries, under the fiscal sponsorship of Community Initiatives, and shortly thereafter welcomed Library Carpentry as a Lesson Program.
