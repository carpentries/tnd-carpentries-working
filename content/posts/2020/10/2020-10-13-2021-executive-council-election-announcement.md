## Carpentries Executive Council Election FAQ
The Carpentries Executive Council’s election process is determined by [The Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html). Below are several frequently asked questions that will help you understand the process. <br /> <br />
**1. What does the Carpentries Executive Council do?** <br />
The Carpentries Executive Council is the [governance body](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/09/executive-committee-structure/) of The Carpentries organisation. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries’ public image. Members of the Council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organisation’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.

More information about the Executive Council’s purpose and activities can be found in the [bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council) and our [Roles and Responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/blob/master/process/roles_responsibilities.md) document.

**2. What expertise does the Executive Council need?** <br />
In general, Executive Council members possess some of the following characteristics:
Experience with non-profit finances and fundraising, especially with regards to sustainability
Experience with developing sponsorship programs and working with corporations
Familiarity with non-profit and open source governance
Membership in or previous experience working with diverse communities
Understanding and passion for The Carpentries Mission and Vision
Time to participate fully in Executive Council and other Carpentries activities
Previous experience at the Executive Council/Board level

**3. How long is the Executive Council term and when does it start?** <br />
The term for Council members is two (2) years, with new terms beginning on __February 1st__, following the election. Terms are staggered so that approximately half of the community-elected and half of the Council-elected members are elected each year.

**4. How much time would I need to commit to serving on the Executive Council?** <br />
The Executive Council meets online at least ten (10) times per year -- usually once a month -- for 60-90 minutes. Members are expected to attend at least 75% of these meetings. The Council typically meets face-to-face once a year (with remote options available for those unable to travel for any reason), and members need to make themselves available to participate in this event. Ad hoc groups may meet in addition to this, and individual members will be responsible for taking on work between meetings. The Chair and Treasurer, which are elected from Board members, spend considerable additional time on Carpentries matters. See our [yearly timeline](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/blob/master/process/timeline.md) for more details on our general activities and when they take place.

**5. Are Executive Council members compensated?** <br />
Council members are not compensated for their contributions to The Carpentries, with the exception of administrative support, travel, and accommodation costs related to their duties on the Executive Council. This generally covers our one in-person meeting per year, but does not cover travel to CarpentryCon or other Carpentries-related events.

**6. How do I know if I am a voting member?** <br />
Only voting members of The Carpentries can vote in the election and self-nominate for community-elected positions. To be a voting member, you must meet one of the following conditions: <br />
- Every individual who has completed instructor or trainer certification in the past year (November 25, 2019 - November 22, 2020)<br />

- Every individual who is a certified instructor or trainer and has taught __at least two__ workshops of The Carpentries in the past two years (between November 24, 2018 and November 22, 2020)<br />
- Any individual who has participated on a committee, served as a Carpentries Mentor or Maintainer, or otherwise made a significant contribution, to any Lesson Program or The Carpentries organisation in the past year, as determined on a case-by-case basis by the Executive Council, and thus is considered active in the community.
