[In July The Carpentries announced][1] [Glosario][2], an open source, multilingual glossary of data science terms. Since that blogpost was published, almost 200 more terms have been added to the glossary in English, along with many more definitions in other languages. In the future, the resource will help lesson developers and maintainers make their materials more findable,  allow learners to identify paths between lessons, and support non-English speaking learners in grasping lesson material.

[Hacktoberfest][3] is a [“month-long celebration of open source”][4] run by [DigitalOcean][5], during which participants can register their contributions to open source projects on GitHub and qualify to receive a free t-shirt or plant a tree.

### We need you!

This month, as part of [Hacktoberfest][3], we are encouraging all members of our community to **contribute to the expansion and internationalisation of Glosario**. So far, the glossary includes definitions in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, and has been designed to include definitions in any language. We would love to see our international community come together to provide definitions and translations in these and other languages, to increase the value of this resource for everyone, regardless of the language(s) they use.

### How you can contribute

**You do not need to know any particular programming language to contribute to Glosario**: anyone possessing a basic familiarity with the GitHub web interface can get involved! We have prepared [a detailed and accessible guide for contributing][6], which has been translated into several languages. (A huge thank you to [Renato Alves][7], [Beatriz Milz][11], [David Pérez-Suárez][9], [Peter Steinbach][10], and [Masami Yamaguchi][8] for their help!) Contributions are welcome in **any** language, not only those represented in that document.

Those who are unsure about working in GitHub should find this is a fantastic opportunity to get comfortable with the system, while using their knowledge to the benefit of many others in the future. Those with more experience of GitHub are also encouraged to get involved: **the more terms and translations are available in Glosario, the greater the value of the resource for everyone**.

To help expand Glosario, please define a new term or add a definition in another language to an existing term by following the instructions in the contributing guide. To ensure that your contributions are included in Hacktoberfest and count towards you planting a tree or receiving a free t-shirt, remember to register on [the Hacktoberfest website][3].
