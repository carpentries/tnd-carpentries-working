The Carpentries Philanthropy is a newly launched mailing list for members of our community who are interested in learning more about how they can help support our mission of building global capacity in essential data and computational skills, and broaden The Carpentriesâ€™ impact on the world around us.

By joining The Carpentries Philanthropy, members will be among the first to learn about   initiatives in development, and find out how to directly support those efforts. Being a part of The Carpentries Philanthropy is an opportunity to help us bridge the gap between the work we have done and the work we strive to do, all with your help.

Some of the content we are planning on sharing through the list include:
- Invitations to discussions with the Core Team about upcoming projects
- Calls to Action to donate to new and existing Carpentries initiatives
- Updates on projects funded by Carpentries donors

The Carpentries is and always will be a fundamentally community-based organisation, and we want to honor that by inviting you to the early stages of our philanthropic processes. You will  see how your donations and support directly benefit our global community. We could not function without our community, and The Carpentries Philanthropy is a way to showcase the amazing, exciting work we are able to do with your financial support.

We are extremely proud of the work we do, and we want to do so much more. The Carpentries is funded in part by grants and donations, and donating even a small amount can make a big difference - we value all contributions. If you choose to donate, your support will allow The Carpentries to expand into new geographies and new disciplines, and will help bring workshops to individuals who might otherwise have barriers to participation.

Donating is not the only way to support us. By joining The Carpentries Philanthropy, you will also receive news about other ways to get involved, including calls for feedback on new initiatives, opportunities to volunteer, and more.

As always, we welcome and deeply appreciate the support you give. Thank you so much for being a part of The Carpentries. We are truly lucky to have you here!
