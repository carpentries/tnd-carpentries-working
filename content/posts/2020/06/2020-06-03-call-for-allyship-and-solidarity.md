As we consider these and countless other Black Americans who were victims of senseless acts of violence, hatred, and racism, we are emotionally drained. Their deaths have reminded us that racial amnesia causes those in positions of power to forget the systemic inequalities that built America. Persons of African descent have been disproportionately targeted by law enforcement and others in positions of privilege, as evidenced by racial disparities in America’s criminal justice system. The ripple effect of this injustice has made its way around the globe. Add to that the unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - ***We can’t breathe***.

We find solace in being members of The Carpentries community. Our community engages daily in the struggle to democratise data and computational skills, to redistribute power to individuals who have been marginalised, and most of all to engage in and solve problems through collaboration, equity, and access. The individuals who make up our community are the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource.

Through our programs, we are working to positively impact the broken power structures and resource distribution that negatively impact communities of color within the United States and around the world. We are empowering diverse groups of people to work with data and code. This is wonderful, and yet, there is more we can do.

If you are in a position of privilege, we implore you to leverage that privilege to combat the systemic inequalities prevalent on a global scale, and advocate for equity and inclusivity in your own communities. If you believe in our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.code_of_conduct_url }}) and [Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/), you are an ally.

In this moment in our history, silence is complicity. Now is the time for empathy and empowerment. We encourage you to get involved by exploring some of the resources below, and sharing your support with us via Twitter at [@thecarpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries).
