CarpentryCon @ Home kicks off on July 14 and now is a great time for as many as are interested in our community to get involved - comment on session proposals you would like to see, contribute to sessions still looking for help, and volunteer to be a call host for your region. _**A big thank you to [Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/) for making CarpentryCon @ Home possible.**_

### Help Us Review Proposals

We invite you to review sessions proposed for [CarpentryCon @ Home](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/) by other community members in [the issues section of this repository](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). Reviewing proposals is a two-step process:
- Read each proposal, ask clarifying questions or volunteer to help run the session in the comments section, and
- Upvote (using the thumbs-up emoji üëç) or comment on the proposals you would like to see included in the six-week schedule between 14 July - 31 August 2020.
Please note that all CarpentryCon @ Home sessions will be expected to adhere to The Carpentries [Code of Conduct]({{ site.code_of_conduct_url }}).

### Volunteer to Help Run Specific Sessions

Several proposals are looking for contributors, specific feedback, or session co-chairs. All of the sessions in need of community input can be found under the [help wanted](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag.

Another way to contribute to CarpentryCon @ Home is by becoming a **Regional Session Host**. Because CarpentryCon @ Home sessions will be delivered remotely, we are looking for local community members to help host CarpentryCon @ Home sessions slated to take place at specific times. [Here is a breakdown of timezones we have bundled up](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals/blob/master/README.md#timezone).

#### What is the role of a Regional Session Host?

Borrowing from [The Carpentries guide to running online CarpentryConnect events](https://carpentryconnect.org/online/#CallHosts), the role of Regional Session Hosts will include:
- Introducing speakers at the start of their session in the online event
- Recording the session after introducing the speaker(s)
- Skimming through questions raised during the presentation and decide which ones to prioritise for the time slotted for Q&A
- Preparing a set of summaries for the last 5 minutes of the call, explaining
  - where attendees can continue with discussions after the virtual session
  - what attendees can expect in the coming days i.e. - recording of the call will be released, for example, an invitation to collaborate on a post-session blog post or survey, etc
- making sure the Code of Conduct is being followed during the online session.

The CarpentryCon @ Home Task Force will offer an orientation to regional hosts before the event begins.

#### Sign me up!

To volunteer as a regional host, sign up here [Google Doc signup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ONzgvIilIy1T_9ad_CDFmSGR_VjqEXTKyz1fit9iXA/edit#gid=1983293344); the timezones are organised in sheets.
The task force will be in touch in late June to organise orientation sessions for the hosts and answer questions.
