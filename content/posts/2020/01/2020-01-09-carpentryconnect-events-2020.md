The first community conference designed for the global Carpentries community, [CarpentryCon 2018](https://2018.carpentrycon.org/),  was held in Dublin, Ireland between May 30 and June 1 of that year.

Since then, community members have expressed great interest in coming together more frequently to exchange ideas and knowledge, collaborate and network, and have found the opportunity to do so in smaller events in their regions and cities. To create a distinction between the global Carpentries community conferences - CarpentryCon, and regional community convenings, The Carpentries dubbed the latter **CarpentryConnects**. 

Three CarpentryConnect events have taken place to date and they are:
- [CarpentryConnect Davis](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/CarpentryConWest.html) in May 2018 that was also known as CarpentryCon West, 
- [CarpentryConnect Johannesburg](https://carpentryconnectza.org/) in September 2018 and 
- [CarpentryConnect Manchester](https://www.software.ac.uk/ccmcr19) in June 2019. 
The success of these events is as a result of the collaborative effort, dedication, rigorous planning and execution by community members in the respective regions.

In addition to our **global** community conference, [CarpentryCon 2020](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/), which is scheduled for June 2020 in Madison,  three more **regional** Carpentries events are set to take place in New Zealand, Germany, and the East Coast, US in 2020. Carpentries community members that are involved in planning for these events are keen to get as many people from their respective regions involved in activities around these events, and have provided more detail about their CarpentryConnects below:
