2020 is here and we are a few months away from one of the biggest Carpentries events of the year - [CarpentryCon 2020](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/)! The Task Force is working hard to plan an exceptional event, and we are excited to announce that conference registration is now open.

We cordially invite you to [register for CarpentryCon 2020](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carpentrycon-2020-tickets-88906089507). The conference is set to take place between June 29 and July 1, 2020 at the [University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA](https://www.wisc.edu/)  where we will be *“Growing Inclusive, Computational Communities and Leaders”*.

The agenda will be filled with workshops, networking and community building. Attending this event will 
- be a great way to meet others in the community that you have talked to and collaborated with online,
- allow you to hear from local Carpentries champions about tried and tested methods for building strong local communities
- give you access to sessions when you will share and learn essential skills around coding, leading projects, community organisation, curriculum development and other professional development 'must-haves'

This is the event you do not want to miss. Go ahead and mark your calendars and [get your conference ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carpentrycon-2020-tickets-88906089507) today! 

CarpentryCon is a non-profit, community-run conference. Ticket sales will help offset costs for catering as well as venue costs and travel support for speakers/attendees. While CarpentryCon prides itself on hosting all that are interested, we trust and appreciate that conference registrants will choose the highest ticket tier that they or their institution can afford.
