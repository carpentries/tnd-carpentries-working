In April 2020 we released [version 2 of The Carpentries Long-Term Survey Results](https://zenodo.org/record/3753528#.X3Ae3NZlA0o). We learned that more than half of survey respondents use self-guided Data, Library, or Software Carpentry material months after attending a workshop. As the unprecedented Coronavirus pandemic has pushed our community to transition to [virtual instruction](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/), we are interested in receiving feedback from individuals who participated in a workshop in the last 6 months. There is much to learn about where learners are in their journey.

Our [Long-Term Survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/cUoZrl) is open, and we would like anyone who has taken a Data, Software, or Library Carpentry workshop between January 1, 2020 and September 1, 2020 to provide feedback by completing the survey.

We look forward to learning about and sharing the results of our long-term survey with our community, and comparing the results for in-person instruction with virtual instruction.

__We will collect long-term survey results until 31 October 2020__, so please share the survey in your Carpentries networks. Our goal is to collect at least 100 responses. We want to hear from our learners about their experiences and ongoing involvement in The Carpentries, especially given the current climate. Your responses will help inform ongoing programmatic improvements.

If you are interested in our assessment resources, I invite you to check out our comprehensive [reports page](https://carpentries.org/reports/). As always, [get in touch](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if you have questions or concerns. We love hearing from our community.
