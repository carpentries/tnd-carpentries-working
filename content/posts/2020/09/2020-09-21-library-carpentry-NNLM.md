We are pleased to announce our efforts to build the data skills of information professionals through our relationship with the Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM). NNLM members will make use of the skills taught in Library Carpentry (LC) workshops to benefit health, health information, and biomedical research communities.

The NNLM Training Office (https://nnlm.gov/nto) at the Eccles Health Sciences Library - University of Utah will work with The Carpentries to bring core lessons of Library Carpentry virtually to NNLM. In addition to virtual Library Carpentry workshops, The Carpentries will train NNLM members as Library Carpentry instructors, and pilot additional curriculum in the online environment.

We are so grateful to be in a position to foster open science and scholarship, and advance biomedical research through Library Carpentry workshops. This work is in support of the [National Library of Medicineâ€™s 2017-2027 Strategic Plan](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/plan/lrp17/NLM_StrategicReport2017_2027.html) and supports Goal 1 of [The Carpentries Strategic Plan](https://carpentries.org/strategic-plan/), specifically, our objective to strategically engage libraries and research computing centres.
