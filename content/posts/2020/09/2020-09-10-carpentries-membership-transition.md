Carpentries Community,

I am writing to share that Elizabeth Williams (former Director of Membership) has departed The Carpentries effective 9 September. While we are sorry to see Elizabeth go, we are pleased to say there will be minimal disruption to the efforts of our Membership Program. We have established a plan to maintain routine membership tasks and inquiries, make progress on membership program development and infrastructure, and engage in new membership inquiries and conversations. Our [membership@carpentries.org](mailto:membership@carpentries.org) email is the best place to send questions and inquiries during this time.

This community has committed to the growth and spread of The Carpentries, and as your Executive Director, I commit to seeing us through this transition. If you would like to [reach me personally](mailto:kariljordan@carpentries.org), I would be happy to hear from you.

Thank you for all you do in support of The Carpentries.
