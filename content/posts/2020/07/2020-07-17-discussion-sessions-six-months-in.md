The [Carpentries Community Discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?) are designed for everyone in The Carpentries community interested in learning, educating and advocating for teaching foundational coding and data science skills globally. Pre and Post-workshops discussions are designed for those getting ready to teach or having recently taught to come discuss their workshop with the community. Many Carpentry workshops globally are now hosted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic; these discussions also allow instructors to share unique online teaching experiences to instructors in-training who join the call during their check-out process.

In the last six months, the pre- and post-workshops discussions have grown from strength to strength. Not only have we automated the signup process for [Community Discussion Hosts](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?#who-can-host) with the use of Calendly and 'some' magic from the Infrastructure Team, we hosted more than 50 pre- and post-workshop as well as two themed discussions on our [new online workshop series](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/05/online-workshop-themed-discussions/).

The infographic below holds more information on pre- and post-workshops discussions held in The Carpentries over the last six months:
