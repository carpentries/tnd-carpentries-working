As work on [The Carpentries Online Workshops Pilot](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/taking-your-carpentries-workshop-online/) continues, The Carpentries is launching a new series of monthly themed discussions, led by members of The Carpentries Core Team. The goal of these calls is to discuss ongoing work around online workshops — from changes to workshop registration to best practices in using technology to manage the shift to online-only workshops.

Additionally, these themed discussions will allow time for direct communication with our community on experiences, learnings, challenges and questions arising from online workshops.

If you would like to attend these sessions, please sign up at [The Carpentries Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

### Session One
The first in this new series of monthly themed discussions will take place from **5 to 6 pm UTC on Monday, 1 June**, and will be a collaboration between the Workshop Administration and Infrastructure Teams of The Carpentries Core Team.

### What will be covered?
We will have three segments, each led by a member of The Carpentries Core team, followed by a Q&A session. The discussion will consist of the following topics:
 1. **Planning/registering your online workshop** - Led by Deputy Director of Workshops and Meetings, Sher! Hurt
 2. **How to use Zoom for online workshops** - Led by Quality Assurance Manager, Maneesha Sane
 3. **How to fill out the workshop template to set up your website correctly for online workshops** - Led by Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer, Zhian Kamvar, PhD
 4. **Q&A session with all**

### What comes next
We hope you are able to participate in this new series. We will be publishing information about next month’s session in the series when available. If you are unable to attend, a recording will be made available on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/thecarpentries) channel.
