We cannot meet in person for CarpentryCon 2020, so we are bringing CarpentryCon to you! CarpentryCon @ Home is an online series of events happening in July and August, sharing some of the great content that was planned for CarpentryCon 2020 in Madison including keynotes, breakouts, lightning talks, and socialising.

>_**A big thank you to [Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/) for funding The Carpentries and making it possible to plan for CarpentryCon @ Home.**_

### Get Involved

We will be building the schedule for CarpentryCon @ Home based on your community submissions and feedback. There are two ways to get involved:

#### 1.  Submit a session proposal.

All community members are welcome to submit a proposal for the following session types:
-   Breakouts
-   Panels
-   Social events
-   Skill-ups
-   Project sprints
-   Lightning Talks *a five minute talk on a topic related to the theme*

A description of each session type is available within the proposal repository (see below).

*If you submitted a proposal to the original CarpentryCon event, we have contacted you about including your proposal in CarpentryCon @ Home - please check your email and respond accordingly!*


#### 2.  Review submissions.
This is a community-driven event - please “+1” the session proposals you like, offer comments, and feel free to collaboratively build new proposals during this time.  

### How to Submit and Comment

To submit proposals, go to the [CarpentryCon @ Home Proposal repository](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals). A new proposal can be submitted by creating a new issue with our proposal template. If GitHub is not accessible to you, please email the [CarpentryCon @ Home task force](mailto:carpentrycon@carpentries.org) with your ideas and we will post a proposal for you or send you a summary of the current proposals.

To view and comment on submitted proposals, go to the [Issues tab of the CarpentryCon @ Home Proposal repository](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals/issues) and take a look!

### Important Dates
The deadline for the first round of CarpentryCon @ Home scheduling will be **Monday, June 8th.** The CarpentryCon @ Home task force will be monitoring submissions throughout the submission period and doing a group review every Monday morning.
