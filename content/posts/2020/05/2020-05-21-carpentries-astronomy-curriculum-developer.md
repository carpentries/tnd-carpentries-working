We are ecstatic to welcome Dr. Allen Downey as our new Astronomy Curriculum Developer! Allenâ€™s role is supported by [a grant from the American Institute of Physics](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/12/astronomy-curriculum-developer/). His work will focus on developing a set of 3-4 Carpentries-style lessons on data organisation, data management, interactive data visualisation, and publishing data for longevity and interactivity - targeted towards astronomers. Allen will join the team part-time over the next six months to develop and pilot test these lessons. Welcome to the team Allen!

### Message from Dr. Allen Downey

I am looking forward to working with The Carpentries to develop a new curriculum in Astronomy.  I have been a fan of The Carpentries for a long time, even more so since I completed instructor training last summer.

I have been teaching at the college level since 1990, as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Berkeley, then as a professor at Colby College, Wellesley College, Olin College, and Harvard University, all in the eastern United States. I teach classes related to computer science, data science, physical modeling, digital signal processing, and engineering design.

I write books on software and data science including Think Python, Think Stats, Think Bayes and Modeling and Simulation in Python. All of these books are available under free licenses from [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com). Most recently, I developed a introductory [Data Science curriculum](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience) and I am working on a gentle introduction to [Bayesian Statistics](https://allendowney.github.io/BiteSizeBayes/), both using Python and Jupyter.

Since 2009, I have led workshops at conferences like PyCon and SciPy, using many of the same methods as Carpentries workshops and a similar philosophy. I have also developed online classes for Flatiron School and DataCamp.

I am not an astronomy expert, but I am looking forward to learning more by working on this project. I followed with interest the detection of gravitational waves with LIGO (especially because they used Python and Jupyter) and the imaging of a black hole (especially because they used Bayesian inference). We are still in the early stages of planning the new astronomy curriculum, but I hope we will be able to include some examples like this.
