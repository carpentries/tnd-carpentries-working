Mozilla’s Open Source Support (MOSS) program is a $2M annual fund that supports open source projects which broaden access, increase security and empower users. MOSS works directly with practitioners to fund work that helps eco systemically-important open source projects achieve sustainability.

Each year, the [Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) makes awards to open source sustainers which help them advance their work in ambitious ways. At the end of 2019, the MOSS committees elected to make four end-of-year core support grants to a selected number of allied organisations.

The Carpentries is honoured to have received $30,316 from Mozilla under the [Mission Partners](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/mission-partners/) track. The MOSS committee considers The Carpentries a mission-aligned organisation, and we could not agree more. Here’s why.

The [Mission Partners](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) track identifies several commitments, two of which directly align with The Carpentries mission and [values](https://carpentries.org/values/): 

1. We are committed to an internet that includes all the peoples of the earth — where a person’s demographic characteristics do not determine their online access, opportunities, or quality of experience.  
2. We are committed to an internet that catalyses collaboration among diverse communities working together for the common good.

Part of The Carpentries ongoing work has been related to our [Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EIA) Roadmap](https://carpentries.org/files/assessment/equity_inclusion_accessibility_roadmap.pdf).  We recently identified target metrics for each of our programmatic areas, and are working on a way to monitor our progress towards these targets. As one of the goals in The Carpentries newly released [strategic plan](carpentries.org/strategic-plan
) is to _intentionally incorporate equity, inclusion, and accessibility to support a diverse Community_, Mozilla’s support has come at an opportune moment. Our team will be working alongside the community to develop resources to support our EIA objectives in alignment with Mozilla’s Mission Partners track.
We are so grateful to have Mozilla as a [supporter](https://carpentries.org/supporters/). 

We invite you to get involved with our equity, inclusion, and accessibility work. Check out the [equity-and-inclusion repository](
