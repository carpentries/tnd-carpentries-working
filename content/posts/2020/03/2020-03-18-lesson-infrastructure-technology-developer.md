I am super excited to join The Carpentries as the Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer. Throughout my career, I have worked towards making complicated analytical tasks just a bit easier for scientists through both software and training. The chance to work with the wonderful people at The Carpentries on improving the lesson infrastructure is no short of a dream job!

I have just finished a stint at Imperial College London where I worked with both [The R Epidemics Consortium (RECON)](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org) and [Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International](https://msf.org) to develop tools, templates, and training materials for field epidemiologists to perform reproducible analyses in R. I was previously a plant pathologist where I developed tools for population genetic analysis of clonal organisms as well as tutorials and workshops introducing plant pathologists to R, reproducible research, and data management.

The core values of The Carpentries align heavily with my own as a scientist and educator. I deeply appreciate the time and effort it takes to develop welcoming and inclusive lessons that not only leave people feeling energised to take on new challenges in their work, but are also easy to maintain. As a part of The Carpentries infrastructure team, I hope that we can lower the barrier for entry and maintenance of new lessons that will support the professional development of researchers for years to come.
