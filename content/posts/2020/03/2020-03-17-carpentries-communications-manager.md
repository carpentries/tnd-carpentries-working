I am absolutely thrilled to be joining The Carpentries as Communications Manager. I come to The Carpentries after years of working in marketing and communications in the non-profit worlds of theater and arts in New York and Washington DC, after earning Bachelor of Arts degrees in Public Relations and Film Studies. In previous roles, I specialised in graphic design, and creation and strategy of publications and other content. 

I first found out about The Carpentries through a weekly listserv highlighting opportunities in non-profits, and was immediately struck by the work that The Carpentries is doing and their mission-level commitment to inclusivity on a global scale. I am absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to bring my knowledge and experiences to the global community of The Carpentries. 

I am especially excited to further the community development work that has been done already and find new ways to engage the community through design and communication. I am also very interested in helping develop new modes of communication that serve members of our community around the world. 

If you would like to reach out to me to discuss anything, please feel free to email me at [okhan@carpentries.org](mailto:okhan@carpentries.org).
