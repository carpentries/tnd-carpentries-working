### Apply to serve on our 2020 - 2021 IDC Leaders cohort

The IDC was established to support instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. The committee promotes community-building and networking by providing (virtual) spaces where instructors from all over the world can share success stories and discuss strategies for overcoming challenges while teaching.

#### Benefits of Leading the IDC

There are many benefits of leading the IDC. Some include:
- Collaborating with dedicated members of our community to help mentor and build community.
- Improving and creating new resources for our instructor and mentoring communities.
- Collaborating with amazing Carpentries instructors and instructors-in-training.
- Gaining experience in community organisation.
- Learning more about how The Carpentries functions as an organisation.

#### Expectations of IDC Leaders

Here is an outline of what to expect when serving as an IDC leader:
- Host one of the two monthly Instructor Development Committee meetings. We estimate that each meeting will last for 45 minutes to an hour.
- Spend an average of two hours/week working on IDC projects and communications.
- When possible, help host or co-host [community discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html). Each discussion session lasts an hour.
- Communicate challenges and opportunities with The Carpentries Core Team liaison to the Instructor Development Committee, Serah Njambi Kiburu.
