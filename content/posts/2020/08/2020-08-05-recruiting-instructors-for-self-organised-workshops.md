It has been nearly four months since The Carpentries started offering online workshops. With the release of [version two](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/) of the online workshop recommendations, we have been able to offer resources for all [instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) to effectively organise a workshop.

The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team has seen an increase in workshop activity, particularly for Self-Organised workshops. Being able to offer Carpentries workshops online allows organisations to reach a wider audience and we are extremely excited.

If you are organising a Self-Organised workshop, there are resources for you to recruit Instructors, Supporting Instructors and/or helpers. Below are the channels you can use:
- Any **local or group-specific** mailing list on [TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups).
- Any **local or group-specific** slack channel.

We ask that you only use the resources listed above. Please **do not** use the following channels to recruit instructors or helpers for Self-Organised workshops:
- [Discuss list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss) on TopicBox.
- [General Channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C03LE48AY) on Slack.
- [Instructors Channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C08BVNU00) on Slack.
Any recruitment messages sent to these channels will be removed.

*For more information about our Lists in TopicBox please refer to this [blogpost](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/channels-to-join-topicbox/). If you would like a local mailing list or slack channel created or need help subscribing to one, please contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org)*

We would like to encourage you to continue to coordinate Self-Organised workshops. Please be sure to [register your workshop](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/) so that we can give you credit and provide you with the survey links to help you prepare for your workshops.

See our [FAQ page](https://carpentries.org/workshop_faq/#online-workshops) for more information. The Workshop Administration Team or your [Regional Coordinator](https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/) is here to help you.
