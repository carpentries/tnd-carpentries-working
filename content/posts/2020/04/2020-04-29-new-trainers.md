Our Instructor Trainer Training program is still actively under development as we look to expand our capacity in the coming years. Huge thanks to these participants not only for their enthusiastic contributions to our discussion meetings, but also for their contributions to the continuing development of this training. We expect our [curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/) for this program to be prepared for broader application in time for our next cohort.

Want to become an Instructor Trainer? Please [get in touch](mailto:team@carpentries.org), and we will be sure you are notified when our next round of applications opens! We expect to run at least one more round of Trainer Training in 2020.
