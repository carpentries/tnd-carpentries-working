## Software Carpentry lessons in Japanese

As previously discussed we have a Japanese language team aiming to maintain a community-led
 translation of the core Software Carpentry lesson. See our previous posts on 
[how we got started](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/local-team-japan/) and
[how we manage collaborative translations](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/translations-in-japanese/)
 via GitHub. Our team has grown internationally in the age of online meetings with contributions from Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the USA. We hope this will support growing the Carpentries community
in Japan and Carpentries lessons for Japanese learners overseas.

We are pleased to announce the complete lesson materials have been translated to Japanese for the 
"R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis" course (extras and other content is in progress).
See the links below for a web version hosted on our GitHub organisation. This uses the 
"carpentries-i18n" theme for multilingual lessons. Shell and Git lessons are in progress
towards our goal of a complete Software Carpentry core lessons in Japanese. We believe the
R lessons are ready to share with the wider  community and welcome feedback.

The R lesson that we translated is archived so the English and Japanese content matches.
We are grateful to David Pérez-Suárez and the Spanish translation team for building the
tools for this. We plan to use GitHub to merge updates to the lessons in English so that
only new sections need to be translated and hope that this system overcomes previous
issues with maintaining translated lessons. We have expanded on this and provided further
user guides (in English and Japanese) on GitHub if anyone wishes to use them. Inspired by
the Spanish lessons, we wish to include these lessons on the Software Carpentry website
once they are finished.

### Motivations for translation

We focused on the R lesson first because of growing demand to learn the R language in
life sciences and data science. The Japanese translation team grew initially out of the
[\#TokyoR](https://tokyor.connpass.com) community. The #TokyoR meetings and their Slack
workspace (both mainly in Japanese) share updates in the R community and aid new R users.
These activities are hugely beneficial for the community in Japan to learn about 
R and new packages that are typically announced in English. Similarly, thanks to efforts
of the Tokyo R community, resources are catching up in Japanese (such as translation of books)
and they share their expertise with new users.

###  Expected benefits to the community

We make these lessons available freely online for the benefit of the Japanese community,
including Japanese diaspora, around the world. They are now able to learn Software Carpentry
materials in their native language. We believe this has immense benefits to the local community
in Japan and represents a step towards making the Carpentries a truly global community inclusive
of non-native English speakers.

This will aid in running workshops in Japan and getting support from organisations within Japan.
Members of the Japanese team have made presentations on Software Carpentry in both English and
Japanese as the community continues to grow. Being able to run Japanese language or bilingual
workshops will be beneficial to the community in Japan. It is also important for those involved
in organisations to understand the course materials and goals of The Carpentries.

We hope that this effort also inspires translations into other languages. We are indebted to the
wider Carpentries community for developing the lesson materials in English and the Spanish
Carpentries community for developing technical tools we use. We have developed and documented
these tools to encourage new translators to join us. By making lesson materials available to
non-English majority speaking countries and international students, we believe The Carpentries
can have a far wider benefit to communities around the world. Establishing a local community
in Japan and considering equity with respect to language is in line with [The Carpentries
Strategic Plan for 2020-2025](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/01/strategic-plan-2020-2025/).

## Getting Involved in the Japanese Community

We welcome any support to grow The Carpentries community in Japan and abroad in the
Japanese language. While we have held meetings several times, we try to keep everyone
updated online if they cannot attend due to their schedule.

Any support for our efforts to translate the lessons into Japanese, maintain the translated
lessons to keep them up-to-date, and to train instructors in Japan (or with Japanese language
skills) will be appreciated. We hope to keep up our momentum to soon have an active community
maintaining the lessons and using them with Japanese learners.


### What You Can Do To Help

See our posts on [how we got started](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/local-team-japan/)
and [how we manage collaborative translations](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/translations-in-japanese/).
In summary, you can contribute to Japanese lessons by submitting pull requests to
the PO files in this github repository<sup>[1](#i18n)<sup> :

[https://github.com/swcarpentry_ja/i18n](https://github.com/swcarpentry-ja/i18n)

Merging a change to the PO file automatically triggers GitHub Actions and generates the
translated lesson content. We may share how this works at a later date.

We are also interested in training instructors in Japan and holding workshops. Please contact us
if you are able to support this in any way. 

We also actively contribute Japanese terms to the [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/)
project and encourage pull requests to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario).

or send pull requests to our lessons on GitHub. Please note that some translations are ongoing
already (check the issues tab for which are assigned). If you are fluent in Japanese, please
give us feedback on our translations. We are also happy to share how we manage translations
with PO files on GitHub, please ask us if you have any questions about doing it in another language.
