## A message from Danielle

I am truly delighted to be joining The Carpentries team in the role of Workshop
Administrator. I am based in Columbus, Ohio (USA) and I am relatively new to The
Carpentries organisation and mission. However, after a lot of research and a
whole lot of reading, I became quite enamored with The Carpentries and
everything the organisation embodies. Having a background largely involved in
education and community relations, I was excited to see the emphasis on
evidence-based teaching, inclusivity and diversity, and a strong focus on
getting information across to the learner in a way that works for them. I am
thrilled to be working for such an incredible organisation and can’t wait to see
what amazing opportunities this role brings.
