### Learning Objectives

After this lesson, learners should be able to:

- create formatted page content with Markdown
- configure their project to build and serve pages on GitHub
- build a coherent site with multiple pages using the Jekyll framework
- customise the layout and style of the pages on their site

### Target Audience

This lesson guides learners through making websites using Jekyll in a web hosting service GitHub Pages. Anyone comfortable interacting with websites in a web browser and willing to learn how to produce website. Basic understanding of HTML and/or Markdown as webpage authoring languages is welcome but not a must.

## Lesson Progress

The lesson is in the Beta stage, as it has been completed and taught several times by the maintainers.

## How You Can Help Develop This Lesson

We are currently looking for volunteers to test this lesson! The lesson has been taught by the maintainers a few times but we would like it to be more widely used. We can help instructors prepare to teach the lesson and would love to receive feedback on how it could be further improved, based on their experience in the workshop.
