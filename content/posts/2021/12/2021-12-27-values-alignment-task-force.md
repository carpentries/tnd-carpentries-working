Over the last year, our use of certain platforms has been a topic of discussion following the release of information that suggests an organisation may not be acting in accordance with or in alignment with [The Carpentries Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/). These discussions sparked conversations around how [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) decide who we align with.

In response to these conversations, [The Carpentries Executive Council](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/executive-council.html) approved [a charter for a Values Alignment Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2021/Values-Alignment/Values-Alignment-charter.md). The objective of the task force was to outline a set of recommendations that would be used to develop a Due Diligence process for how to identify whether an organisation or service is acting in accordance with [The Carpentries Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/).

Following the completion of its work in October 2021, the Task Force delivered a set of [recommendations](/files/pdf/Recommendations-ValuesAlignment-TaskForce.pdf) to [The Carpentries Executive Council](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/executive-council.html).

Over the next year, the Core Teamâ€™s Business Team will work with the Executive Council to develop a Due Diligence process. The recommendations provided from this task force provide some good ideas and considerations for the process, and we will build on those ideas when carrying these recommendations forward.

A huge thank you goes out to the members of this task force, for sharing their time and thoughts with us as we worked to develop these recommendations. Thank you for your support of our community and our shared values.

If you would like to learn more about what we do, ask a question, or share any concerns about the work of the Business Team, please [get in touch by email](mailto:team@carpentries.org). We would love to hear from you.
