I was so excited to take on this lesson template redesign project with The Carpentries! As with any design project, it was paramount to define our objectives from the start to ensure success. This template redesign began with the below objectives that informed all of my process and choices:

1. **The lesson template should conform to web accessibility standards.**
1. **The lesson template should be optimized for responsive screens and all
   devices.**
1. **The lesson template should be more navigable overall and support both
   learner and instructor needs.**

Over the course of 10 weeks with these objectives in mind, I completed an end to end process to deliver the final redesign of The Carpentries’ lesson template early April! 

## Initial Research

* I spoke with 9 different community members, both learners and students, about
  their experience with the existing template. The goal of this research was to
  better understand the current state and use of the template. The questions
  asked were aimed to **understand user behaviors** and **assess the pain
  points, needs and gaps** that exist in order to have a successful redesign.
* The main takeaways (and their corresponding opportunities) from this round of
  user research were the below:
  - Navigation was a widespread pain point
    + 78% of people mentioned navigation as a pain point in the template.
    + **Opportunity:** How might we improve the navigation for both instructors
      & learners to clearly understand where they are within a lesson?
  - Existing resources are not easily discoverable
    + 44% of people mentioned not knowing about resources or not using them
    + **Opportunity:** How might we improve the discoverability of existing
      resources for both instructors and learners in the redesign of the lesson
      template?
  - Online workshops incur special pain points
    + 100% of instructors spoke about the unique paint points of online
      workshops as compared to in-person workshops.
    + **Opportunity:** How might we improve the UX of the lesson template to
      respond to the unique context of digital workshops during COVID-19 and
      beyond?
  - The template is almost always modified by instructors for reference
    + 78% of instructors said they made significant changes to the template to
      refer to when teaching
    + **Opportunity:** How might we make it much easier for instructors to pull
      out key information to help guide them when teaching a workshop?
  - Current styling doesn’t reflect the lesson quality
    + 44% were concerned that the visuals didn’t match the quality and/or were
      concerned about readability issues
    + **Opportunity:** How might we make the visuals of the lesson template
      better reflect the expert, vetted content that the lesson contains?
  - Explanatory content about the lesson could be improved
    + There was consensus that the resources available for how to use the lesson
      template do not go until enough detail about what is available within the
      template, and how it can be used in different contexts.
    + **Opportunity:** How can the explanatory material about the lesson
      template better convey its use and contents for both instructors and
      learners alike?

## Mid-Fidelity Wireframes, R1

### Design

For this second phase of the project, I took the takeaways from the research
period and translated the insights into design applications and features in
mid-fidelity grayscale wireframes (see example screen below). I completed a
clickable prototype in order to be able to easily test the design.


### Usability Testing

I then set up user testing with 5 different community members (still a mix of
learners and instructors) and asked them to complete a targeted list of tasks to
evaluate the usability of the new design. This stage was concerned with
solidifying the information architecture and structure of the design (hence the
grayscale) rather than the visual design (which comes in the next step!).

## Mid-Fidelity Wireframes, Final 

After gathering the feedback from usability testing and collaboratively evaluating with the Carpentries’ team, we solidified a final version of the mid-fidelity wireframes that was the foundation for the next phase of the design process!


## High Fidelity Designs, R1

### Design

Working off of the finalized wireframes, I began to come up with a design system
and identity for the lesson template. I was given a lot of freedom by The
Carpentries in approaching this visual redesign, but I also wanted to be sure
that the new design of the lesson template didn’t clash too wildly with the
current design of The Carpentries extended brands. You can see a small preview
of some of the new color scheme below!

### Usability Testing

I completed an additional round of testing with a group of 5 (learners and
instructors) to evaluate the usability of the design with the new visual look
applied to the new clickable prototype. Similar to the previous round, I asked
users to complete a series of tasks that allowed me to evaluate the usability of
features and the clarity of visual design applications.


## High Fidelity Designs, Final Delivery 

After incorporating user feedback from this last round and collaboratively
evaluating design details, I was able to finalize the high fidelity screens for
handoff! I can’t reveal the entirety of the design prior to its completion on
the development side, but I will leave you with a small taste of what’s to come.

## Final Thoughts

It was such a pleasure to work on this project! I really enjoyed getting to
speak with the community at large and test with users both familiar and
unfamiliar with the lesson template to build the best version of it to serve The
Carpentries now and in the future.

You will find when all is revealed a lesson template that:
* Is navigable and intuitive (look out for a side nav and clear, reimagined
  information architecture!)
* Is optimized responsively across all devices
* Meets AAA accessibility contrast standards
* Is typographically optimized (readability was paramount!)
* Aesthetically now matches the quality of the content 
* Includes features that cater directly to both learners and instructors,
  respectively
