The UWC eResearch Office promotes and supports the use of advanced information technologies to enable better, faster and higher-impact research.
As research becomes increasingly data-driven,  researchers in all fields require new skills in order to be able to manage their data effectively.
This needs to happen throughout the research lifecycle, thus producing better, faster and higher-impact research. UWC Researchers can find resources and
build solutions for their research data management needs with the help of the eResearch Office.*

From 12-16 April, the eResearch Office hosted UWC’s first [Data Carpentry workshop](https://sadilar.github.io/2021-04-12-UWC-ONLINE/) of 2021. It was an
online workshop held over five mornings, and was attended by over 20 researchers. The workshop was aimed at students and researchers who want to
start learning how to work with their data, and was sponsored by [SADiLaR](http://sadilar.org/).

The eResearch Office promotes and supports the use of advanced information technologies to enable better, faster and higher-impact research, and we hope
to grow the Carpentries community at UWC. [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research.
Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners’ existing knowledge to
enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants are encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their
own research problems.Lessons included data organising and cleaning in spreadsheets and with OpenRefine, and data analysis and visualisation with R and RStudio.
