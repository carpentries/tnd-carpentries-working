As with years past, we have spent some time reflecting on the past year and compiled annual reports which highlight some of our activities and shared accomplishments from 2020.

The 2020 Annual and Financial Reports are now available. The reports can be found on the [Reports](https://carpentries.org/reports/) page, The Carpentries central resource for all reports including yearly reports, grant reports, and assessment reports.

### 2020 Annual Report
[The 2020 Annual Report](https://carpentries.org/files/reports/Carpentries2020AnnualReport.pdf) includes several highlights, notably a  message from Executive Director of The Carpentries, Dr. Kari L. Jordan, and a message written by the Executive Council. In addition, there are summaries of The Carpentries progress on our core operations and affirmations of The Carpentries values and mission.

### 2020 Financial Report
[The 2020 Financial Report](https://carpentries.org/files/reports/Carpentries2020FinancialReport.pdf) continues our efforts to maintain transparency and accountability in our financial data, financial planning and decision making. We have compiled this report to convey pertinent information about the past year’s finances and other items of note. The Financial Report is used by The Carpentries Core Team and Executive Council to inform  funding priorities, financial planning and budgetary goals.

### Thank You
Thank you to everyone involved in the creation of these reports, from Erin Becker’s work on creating the data visualizations for the Annual Report, to Talisha Sutton-Kennedy’s extensive work analyzing the data. An additional thank you to the Executive Council and Executive Director for reviewing the reports and writing their messages. And one final thank you to everyone in The Carpentries community for your many, many contributions.
