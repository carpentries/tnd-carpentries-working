Last year, members of The Carpentries community came together during Hacktoberfest to contribute to [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org), an open source, multilingual glossary of data science terms. [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a [“month-long celebration of open source”](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq) run by [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/), during which participants can register their contributions to open source projects on GitHub and qualify to have a tree planted in your name.

## We need you!
This month, as part of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), we are encouraging all members of our community to contribute to the expansion and internationalisation of Glosario. So far, the glossary includes definitions in 17 languages and has been designed to include definitions in any language. We would love to see our international community come together to provide definitions and translations in these and other languages, to increase the value of this resource for everyone, regardless of the language(s) they use.

## How you can contribute
You do not need to know any particular programming language to contribute to Glosario: anyone possessing a basic familiarity with the GitHub web interface can get involved! We have prepared [a detailed and accessible guide for contributing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gTFR1Pw2Mk3PeNTMS0IHgFnJy-F4PBCGJQ1aMrDHPE/edit?usp=sharing), which has been translated into several languages. (A huge thank you to [Renato Alves](https://github.com/unode), [Beatriz Milz](https://github.com/beatrizmilz), [David Pérez-Suárez](http://dpshelio.github.io/), [Peter Steinbach](https://github.com/psteinb), and [Masami Yamaguchi](https://github.com/masamiy) for their help last year!) Contributions are welcome in any language, not only those represented in that document. If you need help with your contribution, feel free to come ask questions on the [#glosario](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C01G4HYGAQ6) Slack channel (if you are not a member of The Carpentries Slack you can join by [filling this form]({{site.slack_invite}}/)).

Those who are unsure about working in GitHub should find this is a fantastic opportunity to get comfortable with the system, while using their knowledge to the benefit of many others in the future. Those with more experience of GitHub are also encouraged to get involved: the more terms and translations are available in Glosario, the greater the value of the resource for everyone.

To help expand Glosario, please define a new term or add a definition in another language to an existing term by following the instructions in the contributing guide. To ensure that your contributions are included in Hacktoberfest and count towards receiving a free t-shirt, remember to r[egister on the Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register).

## What about the lessons and other projects?
If you would like to contribute to any of our lessons or to other projects managed by The Carpentries and its lesson programs (Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry, Library Carpentry, Carpentries Incubator), your contributions can count towards Hacktoberfest. Please indicate that you would like your pull request to be included by mentioning it in the comment associated with your pull request, and a maintainer for the repository or a Carpentries Core Team members will add the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.
