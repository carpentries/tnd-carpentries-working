The Community Development Team (CDT) is excited to announce the launch of its Q4 project to develop the Community Development Program, a program that will build capacity in community management to support our subcommunities. Subcommunities currently exist to bring our members together who are in the same regions of the world, who have an interest in the same field of research, or who have interest in other focus areas that have emerged over time. The project will launch with the project team conducting interviews and focus groups with leaders of a number of these subcommunities to inform the development of this new program.

One of our goals will be to identify opportunities to merge and enhance three of our existing programs that support community development: [Champions](https://carpentries.org/community/#champions) (currently inactive), [Community Facilitators](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/09/introducing-community-facilitators-program/), and [Regional Coordinators](https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/).

The Regional Coordinators have seen a divergence in their roles over time to include both workshop administration and community management. The new program will restructure the Regional Coordinators program to solely support community management while also aligning it with the others, building on the strengths of each, while offering professional development opportunities for our volunteers.

Once we have identified what this new program will look like, we will be sending out details through our communication channels. The current plan is to develop new training and related materials required to support the program in Q1 of 2022 and pilot the program in Q2 of 2022. We look forward to working with all of you on this important project to build capacity in community management.
