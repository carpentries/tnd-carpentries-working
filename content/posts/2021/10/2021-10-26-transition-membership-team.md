Carpentries Community,

I am writing to share that Al Obayuwana (former Director of Partnership) has departed The Carpentries effective 25 October. 
While we are sorry to see Al go, there will be minimal disruption to the efforts of our Membership Program, which will 
continue to be supported by our membership team - Angelique Trusler, Talisha Sutton-Kennedy, and Erin Becker as interim 
Team Lead. Our [membership@carpentries.org](mailto:membership@carpentries.org) email is the best place to send questions 
and inquiries during this time. 

This community has committed to the growth and spread of The Carpentries, and as your Associate Director, I commit 
to seeing us through this transition. If you would like to [reach me personally](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org), 
I would be happy to hear from you.

Thank you for all you do in support of The Carpentries.
