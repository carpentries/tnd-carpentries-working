The Incubator Lesson Spotlight highlights a lesson under development by our community in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator]. In this edition, we look at the progress being made on [the _{{page.lesson_title}}_ lesson][lesson-pages], and hear from the authors about how The Carpentries community can get involved with the ongoing development of this lesson.

## Lesson Profile

* **Title:** {{page.lesson_title}}
* **Lesson Pages:** https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-business/
* **Lesson Repository:** https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-business

### Learning Objectives

* teach data processing skills that are automated, repeatable, and testable
* apply Python as a replacement for spreadsheet-based analysis

### Target Audience

Python for Business is a software skills training programme aimed at business students. It helps business students learn about basics of programming and how to perform Excel-like tasks with Python.

## Lesson Progress

The lesson is in beta after several alpha pilot runs and a complete rewrite. All lessons are complete but could benefit from some more exercises and a bit more exposition as the Pythonâ†’Pandas pipeline is a bit steep still. The authors have taught a version using the spreadsheet example of each Python equivalent which was well-received, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the current materials.

## How You Can Help Develop This Lesson

We are looking for more exercises, prose elaboration of concepts (such as statistical analysis), and possibly collaboration on an integrated spreadsheet-equivalent as mentioned above.

Community members who are interested in contributing to the further development of the lesson should contact [Neal Davis](mailto:davis68@illinois.edu) or [open an issue on the lesson repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-business/issues/new).
