rstudio::global (2021) is a conference for R and RStudio users that is set to take place on Thursday, January 21 2021. The 24-hour virtual event will kick off at 8am PT / 16:00 GMT / 01:00 JST, and [here is what time that will be for you](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=rstudio%3A%3Aglobal+%282021%29&iso=20210121T16&p1=1440&ah=23&am=55). To cater well to all timezones, rstudio::global(2021)'s schedule spans 12 hours, and repeats from the beginning at the half-way point. [Registration to participate in the conference is free for everyone](https://global.rstudio.com/student/authentication/register) to secure your ticket and attend at your convenience.

The Carpentries will be at rstudio::global 2021, and our team will host informal chat sessions during some of the breaks in between sessions. You can find us at The Carpentries table at designated times in the [conference's Spatial.Chat](https://spatial.chat/s/rstudio) Community Partners Room for discussions around instructor training, lesson development, contributing to R lessons in The Carpentries curriculum, community experiences and recommendations for teaching online and Carpentries community activities in 2021 and mentoring among other things. Everyone is welcome to join in the conversations and share from your experiences in The Carpentries.

The screengrab above shows the Community Partners room layout in [rstudio::global(2021)'s spatial.chat](https://spatial.chat/s/rstudio). Moving your user icon closer to a specific table makes the ongoing conversation around that table more audible for you. Likewise, dragging your user icon away from a table makes the conversation more faint. 

We will be holding discussions in the Community Partners room at the following times, and they have all been added to [The Carpentries community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FTallinn) for ease of reference:
