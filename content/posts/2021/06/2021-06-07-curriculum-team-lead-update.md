## A Message from Erin Becker

I am excited to announce that I have passed on the mantle of Curriculum Team Lead to Toby Hodges as of 1 June. In his role as Curriculum Community Developer, Toby has been a vital member of the team since joining us last August. He has showcased amazing leadership in the development of [The Carpentries Incubator and CarpentriesLab](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/) and in the creation and piloting of [Lesson Development Study Groups](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/ldsg1-retrospective/). Toby has been preparing to transition into this leadership role over the past few months and I have every confidence in his ability to lead the team with verve. I will remain on as a supporting member of the Curriculum Team.

## A Message from Toby Hodges

I am delighted to be taking on the task of leading The Carpentries Curriculum Team.
Erin, Fran√ßois, Michael, and Zhian, are an outstanding team who bring an ideal mix of skills and experience to the work we do, coordinating and supporting curriculum development and lesson infrastructure in The Carpentries.

Under Erin's leadership, the Team has been doing important work to ensure that
[our Lesson Programs continue to grow](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/04/call-for-beta-applications-astronomy/),
while remaining up-to-date and meeting the high standard our Instructor community relies on.
I hope to help them continue to do great things, and match the drive and compassion that Erin brought to the role of Team Lead.

All of our work is only possible because of the amazing contributions of Carpentries community members, who learn from, teach, develop, and maintain lessons, improve the infrastructure behind them,
[help to create new programs](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/12/lesson-development-study-groups/) and
[drive those that already exist](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/11/introducing-Dan-Chen-as-Maintainer-Community-Lead/). There are exciting times ahead for the Curriculum Team, as we work to [overhaul the lesson template infrastructure](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/08/lesson-template-design/), further support the vital work of our Maintainers, re-launch our Curriculum Advisors program, and further develop The Carpentries Incubator and Lab. I am honoured to be entrusted with greater responsibility to support that work, and I cannot wait to get started.

If you would like to learn more about what we do, ask me a question, or share any concerns about the work of the Curriculum Team, please
[get in touch by email](mailto:tobyhodges@carpentries.org). I would love to hear from you.
