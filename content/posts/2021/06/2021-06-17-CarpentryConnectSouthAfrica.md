### What is CarpentryConnect? ###

CarpentryConnect events are regional Carpentry Community meetups that take place outside of the main international [CarpentryCon](https://carpentrycon.org/) meetup. 
The second South African CarpentryConnect will be held virtually and will bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, 
develop new skills, and develop strategies for building strong local communities around digital and computational literacy at universities. 

The main goal of CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 is to build capacity for workshops through instructor training and establish a network for the regional Carpentries
community. The first South African CarpentryConnect took place in Johannesburg, South Africa in [September 2018](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/01/carpentryconnect-jhb2018/). CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 will build on the successes of that first event, to bring together and grow the Carpentries community in Africa even further. **Workshop fees** and **mobile data** for African participants is funded by Code for Science and Society [Event Fund](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/announcing/). 


### What can one expect from CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021? 

The organising committee will be hosting a Data Carpentry and Library Carpentry workshop during the first week (6-10 September) and an Instructor Training as well as the Bonus Module on teaching online events the second week (13-17 September).
