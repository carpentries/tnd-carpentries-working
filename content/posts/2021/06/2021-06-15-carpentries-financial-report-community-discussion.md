Are you interested in discussing The Carpentries' 2020 Financial Report and learning about how it was put together? Last month we announced the release of the [2020 Annual & Financial Report](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/05/2020-Annual-and-Financial-Reports/). Now that those reports have been made available to the community, we have scheduled two themed discussion sessions to dive into the reports later this month.

Please join Carpentries Operations Manager, Talisha Sutton-Kennedy, on a guided tour of the 2020 financial report. This discussion session (or Carpentries Conversation) will begin with a presentation and be followed by a question and answer session.
