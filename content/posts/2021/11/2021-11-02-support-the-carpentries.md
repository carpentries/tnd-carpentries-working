In 2020, The Carpentries ran our first-ever [fundraising campaign](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/11/a-call-to-action-donate-to-the-carpentries/). We learned a lot in that process about the mechanics of fundraising, but most importantly we learned just how passionate you - The Carpentries community - are. Without you, none of our work would meet the level that it does, and our mission of being the leading inclusive community teaching data skills would remain words on a webpage, rather than something that we see every single day in our workshops.

Starting today, November 2, The Carpentries is launching an end of the year donation campaign to raise $5000. The campaign will run through December 31, and funds we get from this campaign will help us:
- Offer greater diversity in the languages we teach and interact in.
- Recognize and appreciate the different cultural norms that exist around data, programming, teaching, and volunteering in different regions to improve our programs and services.
- Collaborate with existing organisations to reach broader communities.
- Authentically engage broader communities, working with, not for them

This year we are asking you, The Carpentries community, to share your accomplishments and continue your support by either:
- Donating to the [fundraising campaign](https://fnd.us/81tdn9?ref=sh_fAVdid)
- Spreading the word and sharing the fundraising link with your network
