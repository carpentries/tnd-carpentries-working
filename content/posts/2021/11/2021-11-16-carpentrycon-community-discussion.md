In October, [The Carpentries Core Team announced](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/10/carpentrycon-at-home-2022/) that we will be hosting a virtual CarpentryCon next year. Since then, we have identified four volunteers from the community to serve as Task Force Co-chairs:

- Annajiat Alim Rasel is a certified Instructor with The Carpentries and is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh
- Rabea Müller is the Regional Coordinator for the DACH region and is located in Köln, Germany
- Trisha Adamus is an Instructor Trainer and is based in Madison, Wisconsin, USA
- Jesse Johnston is a Library Carpentry Instructor and is based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA

Annajiat and Rabea will be leading planning efforts in the eastern hemisphere with the support of Angelique Trusler, African Capacity Development Manager for The Carpentries. Trisha and Jesse will be leading efforts in the western hemisphere with the support of myself, Director of Community for The Carpentries. This will ensure we accommodate all time zones in our planning so that everyone in the community can fully participate no matter where they live.

The first meeting of the Task Force Co-Chairs was held on November 2, and we spent time discussing when we should hold the event and how long it should last. We considered other conferences already scheduled for 2022 and the need to spread a virtual event out over multiple days to limit online fatigue. ***We are excited to announce that we have identified the two-week window of August 1 through August 12 to host CarpentryCon @Home in 2022.***

If you are interested in learning more and ways you can get involved, we invite you to join us for one of two community discussions happening on Tuesday, 30 November at 4:00 pm UTC (s[ee date/time in your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CarpentryCon+Discussion&iso=20211130T16&p1=1440&ah=1)) and 11:00 pm UTC ([see date/time in your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CarpentryCon+Community+Discussion&iso=20211130T23&p1=1440&ah=1)).
