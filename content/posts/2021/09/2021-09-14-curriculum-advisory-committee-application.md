In August 2021, we announced that The Carpentries is [reactivating our Curriculum Advisory program](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/08/reactivating-curriculum-advisory-committees/). Curriculum Advisory Committees provide high-level oversight, vision, and leadership for a curriculum and guide large-scale updates. Each Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) supports and is supported by a group of Lesson Maintainers, who focus on day-to-day maintenance of the lessons.

Joining one of the Curriculum Advisory Committees (CACs) is an excellent opportunity to engage with The Carpentries and be directly involved with the development and leadership of our Curricula.

To learn more about what it means to be a Curriculum Advisor, please visit the [relevant section in The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee).

To ensure the accessibility of our lessons and curricula, we are seeking a diverse group of Curriculum Advisors, including individuals at multiple career levels and sub-disciplines, and across a variety of geographic regions, and cultural and linguistic contexts.

Each CAC should also include at least one active Maintainer, and we encourage applications from both new and experienced members of the Maintainer community.
