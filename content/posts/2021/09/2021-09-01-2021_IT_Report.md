## Feedback and Assessment 
Last year, we shared how The Carpentries [uses feedback and assessment](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/09/how-we-use-feedback/) to measure the outcomes of our work, demonstrate our value to supporters, and make ongoing program improvements.

The Carpentries has a long history of using assessment and feedback to understand how well our programs are running and where we can improve. We have shared programmatic assessment updates and long-term survey results periodically. You can see many of these previous reports on our [assessment page](https://carpentries.org/assessment/). 

This report represents the next evolution of that assessment work. It is a building block to future assessment work, including a deeper exploration into: 
- applicant, trainee, Instructor, and Trainer demographics as we continue to focus on equity, inclusion, and accessibility. 
- trainee outcomes broken down by paths to training, e.g., through membership vs. sponsored admission for individuals or groups.
-  Instructor and Trainer teaching activity, including teaching frequency and retention.
- impact of curriculum updates, policy changes, and other qualitative shifts on survey responses.
- long-term assessment of Instructor Training to evaluate perspectives of Instructors as they begin to teach. 

## Thank you 
**Thank you to our Trainers** who make this program possible, creating a positive and welcoming experience for the development of teaching skills. Trainees' satisfaction and eagerness to spread the word demonstrates inspiration sewn by your efforts. 

**Thank you to anyone who has ever completed -- or made time in their class for -- our pre- and post-workshop surveys**. Reports like this would not be possible without  community support in implementation of our assessment tools.
