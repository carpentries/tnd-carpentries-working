The Executive Council (EC), the leading [governance body for The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/governance/), is pleased to announce the election process for 2022. For information on the roles and structure of the EC, please see the [bylaws in The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#nominations-and-elections). These elections are for *two* community-elected seats, which are selected by all voting members of The Carpentries community. In addition, the EC is looking for recommendations to fill *two* Council-elected seats, which will be elected by the EC. The members whose seats are open for election include Cedric Chambers, Konrad Förstner, Paula Andrea Martinez, and Lex Nederbragt and remaining EC includes: John Chodacki, Aleksandra Nenadic, Michael Smith, Sarah Stevens, and Masami Yamaguchi.

We invite The Carpentries Community to recommend individuals for Community-elected and/or Council-elected positions.

## What expertise do we need on the Executive Council?

The Carpentries Executive Council should represent a diversity of experience and viewpoints from across our global community. The current EC has identified some of the skills/assets which would be most useful during this stage of our organisation’s growth include:
- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion expertise - particularly in the global south
- Regional representation, strongly encouraging representatives of the African, Latin American and Asian communities
- Strategic planning, specifically in nonprofits
- Familiarity with nonprofit and open source governance

## How to nominate someone for an Executive Council-elected position

Use the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd91OdWEsmCF7i496gwLwy-Sw13KyJzcbDkIikeUMpFiawnPA/viewform) to nominate someone for an Council-elected position. The members of the Executive Council serve two year terms. Nominees for Council-elected members do not need to be voting members of The Carpentries. The EC will contact candidates nominated for Council-elected positions to ensure they are prepared to serve if elected. The Executive Council will vote on Council-elected members after the results of the community election are available, and may consider non-community-elected nominees for these positions.

## Are you a voting member?
Only voting members of The Carpentries can vote in the election and self-nominate for community-elected positions. The Carpentries Core team will send out an email to each instructor with their status on the 5th of October. To be a voting member, you must meet one of the following conditions ([from the bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#eligibility-rights-and-termination-for-voting-members)):
