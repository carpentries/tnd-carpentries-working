One of the benefits of being a member organisation with The Carpentries is that you hold a seat on The Carpentries Member Council. This is where member organisations and The Carpentries leadership can discuss what is working and what needs revamping or tweaking. At our last council meeting, recruiting helpers and adjusting to teaching online came up as challenges. Since then, we have begun to provide our Instructors [additional training in online teaching](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/12/Carpentries-Online-Workshops/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1630096548366000&usg=AOvVaw1_KWsn48HLBJzcrIoDXBdZ) and host organisations received templates to support with helper recruitment, enabling our community to teach over 588 workshops online since March 2020.

We also held our [first online CarpentryCon](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/), which was a great success, with over 700 virtual attendees in over 45 dynamic sessions. Another opportunity arose to create more synergy in regions thus bringing communities together. We developed a [Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/), a guide to provide a place to gather a range of community building tools and practices useful for creating peer learning communities in academic and research environments.

On 22 September at 15:00 UTC and 23:00 UTC, [our council meetings will be held in this Zoom room](https://carpentries.zoom.us/my/alobayuwana). Please [RSVP directly to this EtherPad](https://pad.carpentries.org/membership-council) with your name, organisation and email. We encourage all Member organisations to send the person best equipped to discuss your experience thus far with membership and benefits. If other team members would like to join, please RSVP for them as well and if space or numbers become an issue we will reach out individually.

As always, our goal is to listen to what is working so we can share / scale it, understand the barriers and blockers of our Members and their community so we can create collaborative solutions, and dream big with partners and friends about what our future needs and next steps could be.  If you are not able to attend the council meeting our membership team is always happy to take time to meet individually with Member organisations. In addition, meeting notes from the council meeting will be shared.

As we continue to grow and serve more communities it is going to be imperative we have a strong active membership base, I want to thank you in advance for your part and support!
Many hands make light work.
