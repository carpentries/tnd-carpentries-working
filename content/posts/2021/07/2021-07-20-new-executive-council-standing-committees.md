As mentioned in the recent blog post, [On the governance of The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/07/carpentries-governance/), the Executive Council has established standing committees. This post elaborates further on their roles and responsibilities.

## What is the Executive Council and how does it operate?

The Executive Council is the official leadership body of The Carpentries. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organisation’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.


## What is the motivation behind the Standing Committees?

In January 2021, the Carpentries Executive Director proposed the following committee structure as a practical way to manage the work and engagement of the Executive Council. The proposed committees include:

1. Officers Committee
2. Governance Committee
3. Finance Committee
4. Communications Committee
5. Program Committee

[The Carpentries Governance Page Executive Council Standing Committees](https://carpentries.org/governance/#carpentries-executive-council-standing-committees) Section gives detailed composition for each committee.
