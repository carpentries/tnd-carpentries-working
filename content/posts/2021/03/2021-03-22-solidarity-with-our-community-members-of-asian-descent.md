It was not so long ago that our Core Team shared a blog post advocating for empathy, empowerment, and equity, ([A Call for Allyship and Solidarity](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/06/call-for-allyship-and-solidarity/)), in support of our Black community members. Here we find ourselves again facing a painful reality: Anti-Asian violence is rising around the world. A collective trauma is being felt across the Asian diaspora, and I, like many other leaders in open science, am outraged and deeply saddened by not only the [events that took place in Atlanta, Georgia (USA)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/atlanta-shootings-massage-parlor.html) last week, but the overwhelming amount of anti-Asian violence that has been on the rise over the past year. Silence __is__ complicity; I will not be silent.

To our community members across the Asian diaspora, I want you to know that The Carpentries remains committed to [our values](https://carpentries.org/values/), and we are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for you. Our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.code_of_conduct_url }}) is quite clear: **Any form of behaviour that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct.** We value your contributions and participation, and stand in solidarity with you.

Below I have linked to several resources for all of us to educate ourselves, and I particularly invite those who are in positions of privilege to use these resources, amplify this issue, and serve as an ally. _Do not be silent._

In hope and solidarity,<br />
