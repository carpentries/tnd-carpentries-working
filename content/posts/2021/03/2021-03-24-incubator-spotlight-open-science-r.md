The Incubator Lesson Spotlight highlights a lesson under development by our community in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator]. In this edition, we look at the progress being made on [the _{{page.lesson_title}}_ lesson][lesson-pages], and hear from the authors about how The Carpentries community can get involved with the ongoing development of this lesson.

## Lesson Profile

**Title:** {{page.lesson_title}}
**Lesson Pages:** https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/
**Lesson Repository:** https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r

### Learning Objectives
After this lesson, learners should..
Know best practices in data analysis with R: tidy format, transformation, filtering, etc.
Know how to increase scientific reproducibility and openness by coupling R with version control (git).
Be able to create literate programming reports using R Markdown.

### Target Audience

The lesson is aimed at absolute and false beginners in R programming, and particularly early career researchers.

## Lesson Progress

Development of the lesson is about halfway as six hours of the workshop have reached a mature stage. The last four episodes need to be completed or reviewed. The lesson has already been taught multiple times either for students or for early career researchers. The lesson is in pre-alpha state as some episodes are incomplete.

## How You Can Help Develop This Lesson

Contributions to help develop some episodes of the lesson further would be helpful, especially regarding functions or more advanced data analysis methods (e.g. nesting). The lesson authors (Marc Galland, Stijn Van Hoey, Tijs Bliek) would prefer potential contributors to contact them via The Carpentries Slack workspace where possible.
