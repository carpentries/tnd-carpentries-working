The [Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/) will host its first Community Discussion of the year (UTC) Monday 27 March 2023 09:30 a.m. 
During this discussion, there will be an overview of the EC's quarter-one meeting and an opportunity for community members to ask questions about 
our governance. Sign up to attend the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

We encourage you to review the past minutes of Executive Council meetings. Minutes are located on the
