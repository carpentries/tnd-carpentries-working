In February, the [Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) community held its third annual election for 
[Trainers Leadership](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md), a Committee that 
provides governance and development support to our growing subcommunity of Instructor Trainers, and makes 
decisions on behalf of that community that affect our Instructor Training program and related policies.

In their second year as an elected body, the Trainers Leadership Committee (TLC!) oversaw many important changes. These included:

* The first implementation of the Certification Renewal process approved by the Trainer community in 2021. The careful oversight of 
Leadership made this a successful milestone, balancing goals to maintain a community that is active, sustainable, and inclusive.
* Creation of a transparent process for proposal and scheduling of Trainer meetings and topics. This lays a foundation for increased community influence on 
and support for meetings that provide enriching and timely development opportunities.
* Design and approval of recommendations to make changes to the Instructor Checkout process, based on a broad community assessment project 
implemented in 2022. The 2023 Leadership will be working with Core Team to plan implementation, with some changes tentatively scheduled for June.
* Creation of more inclusive procedures for this committee, including use of asynchronous commenting and voting to achieve quorum. The challenge of 
operating groups with global representation is significant for all Carpentries subcommunities, and this group aims to create a model for 
procedures that are both effective and manageable for our volunteer participants in all time zones.
* Updating community documentation to better reflect policies and procedures, including changes to the Certification Renewal process and 
documentation for this Committee. These changes were presented to the full community and ratified during the election in February.

Details on these and other accomplishments of this Committee are available in the 
[reports](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/reports) and [issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues) sections on the 
Trainers repository.

### Annajiat Alim Rasel

I am Annajiat Alim Rasel, a Sr. Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering under the School of Data and Sciences (SDS), 
Brac University, Bangladesh. I usually teach problem-solving skills using Java and Python while trying to explore the exciting fields of 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Parallel, Distributed, and High-Performance Computing (HPC). I feel privileged to be a part of The 
Carpentries community and am trying to gain more knowledge, skills, and experience. It is amazing to work on Open Source materials and 
good teaching practices. We hope to build a Carpentries community in Bangladesh. We are trying to learn more about FAIR and CARE principles 
while trying to promote diversity, localization, and accessibility.


### Nathaniel Porter

I am the Social Science Data Consultant and Data Education Coordinator in the Virginia Tech University Libraries and Department of Sociology. 
In addition to coordinating over 20 local Carpentries instructors to organize at least 10 Carpentries workshops a year at Virginia Tech, I teach 
Sociology courses and a variety of data and programming workshops plus provide 1-on-1 project assistance with both quantitative and qualitative 
social science research. At the Carpentries, I'm also a maintainer for the Instructor Training Curriculum and co-chair of the Data Carpentry
Social Science Curriculum Advisory Committee. My research is split between studying data pedagogy and whatever collaborations develop out of
my consultations - so I've been part of papers on everything from cyberattacks to piglet grimaces. As someone managing ADHD and carpal tunnel,
and as an aspiring decent human being, I also try to be a strong advocate for inclusive research and education practices.
