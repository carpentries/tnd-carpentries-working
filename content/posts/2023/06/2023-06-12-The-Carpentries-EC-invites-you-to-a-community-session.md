The [Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/) will host its second Community Session of the year Wednesday, 14 June 2023, at 20:00 UTC. 
During this discussion, there will be an overview of the EC's quarter-two meeting and an opportunity for community members to ask questions about our 
governance. Sign up to attend the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

During the quarter-two meeting, the Executive Council discussed challenges with lesson governance and received an overview of The Carpentriesâ€™ finances.
