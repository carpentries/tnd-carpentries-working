The Carpentries is [planning our transition](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/08/Carpentries-transition-to-independent-status/) to operate as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation. The transition from fiscal sponsorship to independent 501(c)(3) non-profit status requires a shift in our governance structure from Executive Council to Board of Directors.

A nonprofit Board of Directors is **a group of individuals elected to govern and oversee the organisation's operations**. The board is responsible for setting the organisation's mission, strategy, and goals, and ensuring that the organisation operates in compliance with legal and ethical standards. The Executive Council has served The Carpentries in this capacity as an advisory committee. However, fiscally sponsored projects are governed by the Board of Directors of their fiscal sponsor, in our case, the [Community Initiatives Board](https://communityinitiatives.org/about/our-board/). For more information, read the blog post [on the governance of The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/07/carpentries-governance/).
 
The authorised number of directors of The Carpentries is between seven and thirteen. Seven members were onboarded this year - five of which are current Executive Council members (i.e., John Chodacki, Sarah Stevens, Michael Smith, Konrad Foërstner and Yanina Bellini Saibene). **The Board seeks four additional members elected directly from the community to serve a three-year term beginning February 2024.** Please refer to the [bylaws](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWAdi971_FECHJuzQF8ijhk6GwHHeYem/view?usp=sharing) for further explanation of the Board of Directors.

## The Carpentries Board of Directors Election FAQ
The Carpentries Board of Directors election process is determined by [The Carpentries Bylaws](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWAdi971_FECHJuzQF8ijhk6GwHHeYem/view?usp=sharing). Below are several frequently asked questions that will help you understand the process.

### 1. What does the Carpentries Board of Directors do?
The Carpentries Board of Directors is the governance body of The Carpentries organisation. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries’ public image. Members of the Board also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organisation’s reputation and fundraising. The Board executes these responsibilities through a combination of quarterly meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.

### 2. What expertise does the Executive Council need?
In general, Board of Directors members possess some of the following characteristics:
* Experience with strategic planning for a non-profit or another type of organisation
* Experience with non-profit finances and fundraising, especially concerning sustainability
* Familiarity with non-profit and open-source governance
* Membership in or previous experience working with diverse communities
* Expertise in educational pedagogy
* Understanding and passion for The Carpentries mission and vision
* Time to participate fully in Board and other Carpentries activities
* Previous experience on a Board of Directors.
  
### 3. How long is the Board term, and when does it start?
Executive Council members served for 2 years, but the term for Board members is three (3) years, with new terms beginning on February 1st, following the election. Terms are staggered so that community members are elected every three years.

### 4. How much time would I need to commit to serving on the Board of Directors?
The Board meets online at least four (4) times per year—usually once a quarter—for 60-90 minutes. Members are expected to attend at least 75% of these meetings. The Board meets face-to-face once a year, and members must make themselves available to travel to this event. Ad hoc groups meet in addition to this, and individuals are responsible for taking on work between meetings. The Chair and Treasurer, elected from Board members, spend considerable additional time on Carpentries matters.

### 5. Are Board members compensated?
Board members are not compensated for their contributions to The Carpentries, except for administrative support, travel and accommodation costs related to their duties on the Board. This generally covers the one in-person meeting per year but does not cover travel to CarpentryCon or other Carpentries-related events.

### 6. How do I know if I am a voting member?
Only voting members of The Carpentries can vote in the election and self-nominate for community-elected positions. To be a voting member, you must meet one of the following conditions:
