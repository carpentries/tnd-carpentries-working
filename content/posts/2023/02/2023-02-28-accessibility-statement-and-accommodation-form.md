We are excited to announce that we have developed an [Accessibility Statement](https://carpentries.org/eia/) for The Carpentries. Our team is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible experience for all users, and this statement is an important step towards achieving that goal.

Our Accessibility Statement outlines our commitment to meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards, as well as our ongoing efforts to ensure our lessons, events, and website, are inclusive and user-friendly. We have implemented a number of accessibility features to help achieve this goal, such as:

 - We are updating alternative text descriptions for images in our lessons and making it a general practice to include alternative text on images we are posting, to ensure that users with visual impairments can understand the content.
 - During CarpentryCon 2022 we provided live-captions and sign language interpreters and will continue to offer these accommodations for Carpentries events. 
 - As we update more lessons and web features our goal is a clear and consistent design, with well-organized information, to help users with cognitive or learning disabilities easily navigate the site.

We also recognize that accessibility is an ongoing process, and we are committed to continually improving our lessons and events to meet the needs of all users. We welcome feedback from our community, and we will use that feedback to inform our ongoing efforts to make The Carpentries more accessible.

## The Carpentries Accessibility Statement 

The Carpentries is committed to providing inclusive and accessible content that enables all individuals, including those with disabilities, to participate and engage fully. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of Carpentriesâ€™ content and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines including those from the World Wide Web Consortium. If you have questions or would like to request an accommodation please email us. 

If there are any aspects of our community including the website, community discussions,  instruction, or the design of our lessons that result in barriers to your inclusion, please email us with as much information as possible including the name, location, and date of the event you attended, or any relevant links that provide context (e.g. Slack, GitHub). 

## Accommodation Request Form 

In addition to our Accessibility Statement, we are excited to announce the launch of our [new accommodation request form](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/B2OSYaD0)! At The Carpentries, we understand that everyone has different needs, and we want to ensure that all individuals have the support they need to fully participate in our community.

Our new accommodation request form is an efficient way for individuals to request accommodations for any Carpentries event. The form asks for information such as the event type, date, time, as well as the type of accommodation requested.

We understand that accommodations can make a big difference in the ability of individuals to fully participate in our community, and we are committed to providing these accommodations to the best of our abilities. We will do our best to provide accommodations in a timely manner, and we will work with individuals to ensure that their needs are met to the best of our ability.

Our new accommodation request form is available here and on our website, and we encourage all individuals who require accommodations to use this form to submit their requests. We also encourage individuals to submit their requests as early as possible, as this will allow us to make the necessary arrangements and ensure that accommodations are available when needed.

We are excited to offer this new accommodation request form as part of our commitment to accessibility and inclusion. We believe that everyone should have access to our content and services. Thank you for joining us on this journey towards accessibility and inclusivity!

We are proud to have developed this Accessibility Statement and accommodation request form, and we hope that it serves as an important step towards making The Carpentries more inclusive and accessible. We will continue to work towards making our lessons, workshops, training, and events a welcoming and accessible space for all. We welcome any feedback or suggestions from our community on how we can continue to improve.

Thank you for joining us on this journey towards accessibility and inclusivity!
