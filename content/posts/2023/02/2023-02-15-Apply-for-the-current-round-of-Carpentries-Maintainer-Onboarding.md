The Carpentries is preparing to onboard the next cohort of Maintainers.
[Currently](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/11) we have 109 Maintainers serving across 56 core lessons. To keep the community 
healthy, we need to plan for offboarding people who want to step down from their current positions and finding new people to step into the role.

You do not need to be a Git expert to be a Maintainer. If you are familiar with the Git lessons from either 
[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/) or [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), 
you will have the foundation and support to learn [the skills you will need as a Maintainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWhSYBkZJ0). 
The Maintainer community has a dedicated Slack channel, TopicBox list, and two monthly meetings to help support you and the lesson you are working on.

We are recruiting Maintainers for all of our official lessons, including both English and Spanish language materials. Although Maintainer Onboarding will 
be held in English, we strongly encourage applications from folks who are interested in maintaining one of the four official Carpentries lessons currently 
offered in Spanish.

If you are interested in helping maintain, improve, and grow our lessons, please 
[apply to be a lesson Maintainer](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vqkjrEvic6TJwCAx918T-_x5zFMVwqaiDjI8HnK1wZk).

Applications may be submitted until 
[midnight of 8 March, anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230301T235959&p1=3399).

If you have any questions about the application or about being a Maintainer, please reach out to [The Carpentries team](team@carpentries.org) or to the 
Maintainer Community Lead, Vini Salazar.
To contact Vini, please send him a message on [The Carpentries Slack workspace]({{site.slack_invite}}/).
