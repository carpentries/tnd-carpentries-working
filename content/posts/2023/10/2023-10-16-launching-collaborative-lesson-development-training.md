The Carpentries is launching a new program of Collaborative Lesson Development Training.

Following a couple of [pilot events][cldt-pilot] for the curriculum,
and a first round of Lesson Developer Trainer Training,
today we open up the training program for registrations.


## What does the training teach?
[The Collaborative Lesson Development Training curriculum][cldt-curriculum]
teaches skills and concepts in three broad categories:

1. **Lesson design & development**
2. **Collaboration**
3. **The Carpentries lesson infrastructure**

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

* collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
* identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson
* define SMART learning objectives
* explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks
* create exercises for formative assessment
* explain how considerations of cognitive load should influence the pacing, length, and organisation of a lesson
* use best practices to configure and maintain accessible and usable lesson repositories
  that are readily available for collaboration
* identify and correct accessibility issues in a lesson built on The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
* use feedback and reflection from teaching to update and improve lesson material
* review and provide constructive feedback on lessons.

The training includes regular and extended activities to apply what is being learned,
with participants drafting their new lessons as they progress.

Another post coming soon will explore the beta version of the curriculum in more depth.


## Who is the training for?
The target audience of Collaborative Lesson Development Training is groups of collaborators who have an idea for a lesson that they want to begin developing together. Although it is possible for trainees to attend individually, the curriculum has been developed with collaborative groups of trainees in mind. For more details about the eligibility criteria for the training, visit [the training information page on The Carpentries website][cldt-info].


## How long does the training take?
Collaborative Lesson Development Training
is designed to be taught over six half days, divided into two parts.

<img alt="Structure of Collaborative Lesson Development Training" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/blog/2023/10/CLDT-structure.svg">

In the first part (four half days) trainees will be introduced to
a process for lesson design and development
and The Carpentries lesson infrastructure, [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].
The second part of the training (two half days) takes place after an extended break
and primarily focuses on collaboration skills.
During the break between these two parts,
trainees are asked to test out the new lesson content they have created
and gather feedback to inform the remainder of the development process.


## How much will the training cost?
Visit [the Collaborative Lesson Development Training information page][cldt-info]
on The Carpentries website for more information about the pricing structure for the training.


## How can I apply for training?
Collaborative Lesson Development Training is currently being scheduled,
with training events planned for November 2023, January 2024, March 2024, and beyond.
To register your interest in attending,
please send an email with the names and email addresses of the people who would attend
to <{{site.lessondev_training_contact}}>.


## Who has contributed to this training program?
Collaborative Lesson Development Training has been inspired by experience gained in
[a round of Lesson Development Study Groups][ldsg-pilot],
with the curriculum planned, developed and piloted since July 2021.

A large part of this work was done by the four Maintainers of the curriculum:
Sarah Stevens, Aleksandra Nenadic, Mateusz Kuzak, and Toby Hodges.
But their work was supported and enabled by a much larger group of contributors,
as well as all of the trainees who participated in the training pilot events and provided feedback on the curriculum.

Further feedback was given and contributions made by our inaugural cohort for Lesson Developer Trainer Training,
who will be introduced in another post coming soon.
