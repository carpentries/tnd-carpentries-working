[Learn more about this contracting opportunity.](https://carpentries.org/rfq-web-development/)

## Project Overview
The Carpentries is looking for a developer to build a theme for our website using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). We previously received funding to improve the accessibility and the information structure of our website and handbooks. We have been working toward this goal, beginning with contracting a web designer to evaluate the information architecture and design of our website. The contractor worked with our team and community to outline mockup designs for an updated website and provided recommendations for our handbooks. We are now in need of further support to complete the development for our website.

The developer selected to support this project will be contracted via an Independent Contractor or Service Agreement with our fiscal sponsor [Community Initiatives](https://communityin.org/) on behalf of The Carpentries.

All submissions from interested developers must be received by 1 September 2023 at midnight anywhere on earth.
