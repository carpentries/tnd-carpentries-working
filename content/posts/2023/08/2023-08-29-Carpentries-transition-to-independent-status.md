Community,

When I [became your permanent Executive Director](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/kari-new-executive-director/) in April 2020, I knew I wanted to explore what it would mean for The Carpentries to operate as an independent non-profit organisation. Over the last three years, we have streamlined our operations and governance and [convened a task force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2022/fsp-transition/fsp-transition-charter.md) to plan and implement a roadmap to transition The Carpentries out of fiscal sponsorship to independent, tax-exempt status.

We are thrilled to announce this exciting stage in the journey of The Carpentries, especially as we [commemorate 25 years](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/07/carpentries25-campaign-announcement/) of service to our community. Planning for this transition marks a significant step forward in our mission to provide accessible and impactful training in essential data and computing skills. Since its inception, The Carpentries has played a pivotal role in bridging the digital divide and empowering individuals from all walks of life to harness the power of data and technology. With independent, non-profit status, we will be poised to amplify our efforts and drive innovation in the ever-evolving landscape of data science and research.

**Why Independence Matters**

The decision to transition from fiscal sponsorship to independent 501(c)(3) non-profit status was guided by our commitment to sustainability, growth, accessibility and long-term impact. This move will empower The Carpentries to have greater autonomy, secure dedicated funding, and cultivate strategic partnerships that will enable us to further expand our reach and offerings.

Independence also will allow us to better tailor our programs and initiatives to the evolving needs of our diverse community. As an independent entity, we will have flexibility to innovate, experiment, and respond swiftly to emerging trends and challenges in data science and education.

**Join Us on This Exciting Journey**

The Carpentries' movement towards becoming an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation is a testament to the unwavering dedication of our community, the power of collaboration, and the increasing importance of data and computing skills in our interconnected world.

We invite you to join us on this journey. Next month, we will open community elections for our governance. Stay tuned for updates, announcements, and opportunities to get involved as we embark on this new chapter in The Carpentries' remarkable story.
