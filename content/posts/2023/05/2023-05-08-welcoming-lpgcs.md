**I am delighted to announce the new Lesson Program Governance Committees for
Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry.**
These committees will provide community leadership for each lesson program,
with responsibility to oversee project strategy, advocate for the lesson program and its community,
and to communicate with the Executive Council, the Core Team, and the Carpentries community as a whole.

These committees are essential to the long-term health of The Carpentries as a community-led organisation,
and I am deeply grateful to the following community members for stepping into the role.


## Data Carpentry Governance Committee

- Mike Mahoney
- Ivelina Momcheva (Secretary)
- Ulf Schiller
- Luis Villanueva (Chair)

## Library Carpentry Governance Committee

- Yared Abera
- Mary Filsell
- Ekatarina Grguric (Chair)
- Elizabeth McAulay (Secretary)
- Belinda Weaver

## Software Carpentry Governance Committee

- Samantha Ahern (Co-chair)
- Valentina Hurtado-McCormick (Co-chair)
- Martino Sorbaro (Secretary)
