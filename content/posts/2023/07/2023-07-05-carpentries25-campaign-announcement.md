On 24 July 1998, the first Software Carpentry workshop, led by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda,  came to a close. The workshop aimed to teach researchers skills 
to work more effectively with their data.

*Timeline signifying milestones in the history of The Carpentries.*

This year, 25 years later, on that same day, we will launch a series of events to celebrate this milestone. This launch event will include a conversation with founders and past and present Directors reflecting on the beginnings and evolution of the organisation. After the launch event, from August to December 2023, we plan to spotlight a region of the world each month to demonstrate the contributions and impact of our global community. We will be featuring the regions in the following order:

* Australia and New Zealand during August
* Africa during September 
* Latin America during October
* Europe and North America during November, concluding with 
* Asia during December. 

Each monthâ€™s regional focus will include a virtual event with community members from each region sharing their stories on the contributions and impact The Carpentries has made in their region. We will also be posting blogs and infographics on our social media accounts to highlight the activities of each region and sharing short videos and written testimonials featuring our community members around the world.
