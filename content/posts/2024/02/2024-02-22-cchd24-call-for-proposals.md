The [CarpentryConnect and BioNT community event - Heidelberg 2024](https://biont-training.eu/event-details/CarpentryConnect2024) is expected to be the key community-building and networking event for The Carpentries and [BioNT](https://biont-training.eu/)'s community in Europe, with worldwide participation. Taking place 12 - 14 November 2024, this event will provide the opportunity to bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, develop new skills, and develop strategies for training beyond academia and building strong local and regional training communities.
The event will be held in a hybrid format, allowing workshops to be conducted virtually.

We invite you to [submit proposals](https://survey.bio-it.embl.de/496554?lang=en) to share your knowledge and skills to help enhance research and learning outcomes in different communities. We welcome topics that align with our theme:  _Community-led training beyond academia_, such as:

* Widening career perspectives through training 
* Bridging sectors and fostering collaborations through skill-up training
* Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of different formats with different training audiences, possibly comparing ‘The Carpentries’ with different formats
* Empowering local and global training communities, considering their geographical distribution, as well as their distribution across topics and sectors 
* Expanding beyond the boundaries of one’s community and engaging others 
* Sharing helpful tools for teaching and examples of using them in a workshop
* Training on a range of practical skills
* Running an effective online workshop/teaching effectively online
* Developing novel or existing lesson/curricula, both Carpentries-style and from other training communities (on day 3)

### Submit a proposal
To propose a session, please use [the online submission form](https://survey.bio-it.embl.de/496554?lang=en). 
#CCHD2024 will have four types of sessions plus a day and a half dedicated to the Mini-hackathon and Curriculum Development Session:

* **Breakout discussion sessions** will be 1.5 hours long and conducted in a round table or general discussion format. These discussions will be crucial in connecting participants based on shared interests and stimulating discussion on relevant topics.
* **Skill-up or training sessions** will allow participants to develop new skills in a 1.5-hour or 3-hour session. In this session, you can share technical or transferable skills with others
* **Workshops** are a way for you to pass on your ideas and expertise to other participants in a 1.5-hour or 3-hour session. You can reach out to larger numbers of people by conducting workshops on the topic that you find important and facilitate a positive learning environment for the attendees
* **Lightning talks and posters** will allow you to present your work, idea, interest, etc., in short, 3 to 5-minute presentations or within a poster 
* **Mini-collaboration drive and Curriculum Development Sessions** (on Day 3): If you have an idea for a new lesson or if your lesson is in the early stages of development, feel free to submit the idea/lesson using the same form. There are two sessions scheduled, each lasting 1 hour and 30 minutes.

We are so excited to learn about your ideas for the event!
