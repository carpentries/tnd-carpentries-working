In data science and programming, breaking down language barriers is pivotal for creating an inclusive learning environment. We are excited to announce an event that aligns with this vision – the **Glosario Codefest!** This event, made possible by a grant from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/mellon-foundation/), marks a step forward in advancing data science knowledge and accessibility for our diverse global community.

Developed in 2020, [Glosario](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario) has become a resource for learners worldwide. Glosario's commitment to accessibility is exemplified by its open availability online. Released under a Creative Commons Attribution license, Glosario's content is stored in a structured plain-text format ([YAML](https://yaml.org/)), ensuring machine-readability.

## What’s Next? Glosario Codefest Event

As we embark on this journey, we invite you to participate in our virtual Glosario contribution drives throughout 2024. These drives are designed to increase the number of supported languages and enrich the glossary with additional data science terms, making it an even more comprehensive resource for learners worldwide.

The inaugural Glosario Codefest will coincide with The Carpentries’ Board of Directors retreat in Oakland, California (USA) on **29 February, 14:00 UTC** ([find your time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Glosario+Codefes&iso=20240229T1400); [add to calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MnQxMjk1Zjhoa2s3djNlYms4Y2ZhdjV2cjggYW5nZWxpcXVlQGNhcnBlbnRyaWVzLm9yZw&tmsrc=angelique%40carpentries.org)), you can sign up on this [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/Glosario_Codefest_2024). This event encourages new contributions to Glosario from our governance and global community. The linguistically diverse board, representing regions such as DACH (
Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), Oceania, and South America, will actively translate terms into languages like Hindi, Spanish, and German, expanding Glosario's reach and impact. This event will be followed by regional community events (i.e. African Carpentries Monthly Meetups and CarpenryConnect Events) and quarterly co-working sessions, **15 May, 15:00 UTC** [Add to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTF0djFwbW8zdGY4OTlsZHEyNDlnNzlnZnUgb3NldXVvaHQwdHZqYm9rZ2czbm9oOGM0N2dAZw&tmsrc=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com) and **4 September, 15:00 UTC** [Add to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MDY5bWVjbWM2Y2o2MjVxajI0MWZjbmJlbXYgb3NldXVvaHQwdHZqYm9rZ2czbm9oOGM0N2dAZw&tmsrc=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com).
