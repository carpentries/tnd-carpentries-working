The Carpentries is preparing to onboard the next round of Maintainers. 
Currently we have 92 Maintainers serving across 48 core lessons. 
To keep the community healthy, we need to plan for people wanting to step down from their current positions and finding new people to step into the role.

You do not need to be a Git expert to be a Maintainer. 
If you are familiar with the current [Carpentries Git materials](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), 
you will have the foundation and support to learn [the skills you will need as a Maintainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWhSYBkZJ0). 
[Training](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/) on lesson maintenance workflows 
and [GitHub skill up sessions](https://carpentries.github.io/github-skill-up-maintainers/) will be offered in multiple time zones during onboarding to ensure you have the skills you need to succeed. 

The Maintainer community has a dedicated Slack channel, TopicBox email list, and monthly meetings to help support you and the lesson you are working on. 
Lesson maintenance is asynchronous and can take place wherever it fits in your schedule, although occasional co-working sessions may be organised on Zoom to help work through challenges.

The onboarding, skill-ups, and regular opportunities to connect with and learn from an established community make this a fantastic opportunity to develop your skills 
and get involved in Open Source in a supportive environment.

We are recruiting Maintainers for all of our official lessons, including both English and Spanish language materials. 
Although Maintainer Onboarding will be held in English, we strongly encourage applications from folks who are interested in maintaining one of the four official Carpentries lessons currently offered in Spanish.

If you are interested in helping maintain, improve, and grow our lessons, please [apply to be a lesson Maintainer](https://forms.gle/WWA596sEYc6zMMJ9A). 
You will be asked to choose which technologies (e.g., R, Python) and topics or domain areas (e.g., geospatial, ecology, library sciences) you would be comfortable maintaining a lesson in.  

Applications may be submitted until ~~[the end of 5 April anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Deadline%3A+Maintainer+Onboarding+Call+for+Volunteers&iso=20240405T235959&p1=3926)~~. 
**The deadline has been extended for applications to maintain lessons teaching with OpenRefine**: if you are interested in maintaining one of the three OpenRefine lessons, please fill out the form to register your interest before [the end of 12 April anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Deadline%3A+Maintainer+Onboarding+Call+for+Volunteers&iso=20240412T235959&p1=3926).

If you have any questions about the application or about being a Maintainer, please reach out to [The Carpentries Curriculum Team](curriculum@carpentries.org) or [Maintainer Community Lead](ndporter@vt.edu).
