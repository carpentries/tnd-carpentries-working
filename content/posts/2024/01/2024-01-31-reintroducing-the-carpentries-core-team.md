Until recently, The Carpentries and its community were supported by a 16-member strong Core Team, but due to financial constraints, the organisation [let go of seven members of this staff cohort](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/with-gratitude-to-our-legacy-core-team-members/), reducing the Core Team members to nine. This reduction in staff has necessarily entailed a reduction in the programs and activities the team can continue to lead and support, and tomorrow, 1 February 2024, we will share what continued work for the Core Team will look like moving forward. However, we are confident about and committed to carrying forward our vision and mission; this is [not the first time a small team has supported The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/02/projects-teams-job-plans/), and for 25 years the organisation has grown into its vision of being the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills. 

In this post, we would like to reintroduce you to [The Carpentries Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) and inform you of the changes to some of their roles and titles. 

## Dr. Kari L. Jordan, Executive Director

Kari remains the Executive Director and will continue to work closely with the [newly constituted Board of Directors](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/01/announcing-the-results-of-the-2024-community-election/) to provide the Core Team and the community with executive and strategic direction and support. Additionally, she will lead the work of the Community Engagement Team, whose role is to actively engage members of The Carpentries global community in sustaining the organisation's mission-aligned core activities.
