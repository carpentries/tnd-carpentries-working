We are very excited to announce the upcoming CarpentryConnect Heidelberg 2024 (CCHD2024), scheduled to take place in Heidelberg, Germany, from November 12th to 14th, 2024.

Following the success of [CarpentryConnect Manchester 2019](https://www.software.ac.uk/Events/carpentryconnect-manchester-2019-ccmcr19), we aim to create an event where members of The Carpentries community from Germany and beyond can come together to explore and discuss community-led software and data skills training as well as capacity building initiatives. 

CCHD2024 will feature a diverse range of sessions. The event will include breakouts, posters, lightning talks, workshops and curriculum co-working sessions, all centred around the Theme: 
“Community-led training beyond academia”.

Attendees can expect engaging discussions, hands-on learning experiences and the opportunity to network with various communities.

### Who is organising the event?
The event will be hosted by [The Bio Network for Training (BioNT) consortium](https://biont-training.eu/) with all its international partners and in collaboration with The Carpentries and their community members.
CCHD2024 will run parallel to the BioNT community event, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities.

## About the Venue
The EMBL Heidelberg campus is located in the hills of Heidelberg, surrounded by forest, and a well-renowned venue for holding scientific conferences and courses. 
Several rooms with different sizes and features were booked for the event and will allow hosting workshops of different types. The rooms are distributed between two buildings, the main one and the EMBL Imaging Centre. A detailed map and guide to move around the campus will be shared with the participants later. Additionally, a room for prayer is available in the Advance Training Center on level E0 behind the auditorium on campus. 
The public bus 39A serves the EMBL campus and reaches the city centre and the train station. Taxis can be easily booked from the campus reception.
