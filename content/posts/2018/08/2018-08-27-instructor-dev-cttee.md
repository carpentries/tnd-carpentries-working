After some discussion, at recent meetings of the Mentoring Committee and on
the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/issues/61), members of the Committee have
chosen to rename the group. We will now be the _Instructor Development Committee_.

The discussion came about from an acknowledgement that "Mentoring" implied that
the Committee focussed solely on mentoring activities such as the Mentoring
Groups Program (more on which below). While it's true that part of what we do
is to support the amazing work that Kari Jordan and others do with mentoring groups,
that's only one aspect of the conversations that we have at our monthly meetings
and the activity of the Committee members outside of those meetings.

We also
coordinate the instructor discussion sessions, which [I've gushed about before](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/call-for-session-hosts/),
and would love to work more on new projects to support the development of our
instructor community. We proposed the name change to reflect this, and to reduce
the potential for confusion around the naming of our repositories and mailing
lists (we currently have lists called _mentoring_, _mentees_, and _mentors_).

In practical terms, what this means is that our repository will change its name/URL,
so those of you who have a clone of that repo will need to update your remote
to reflect that. I'll send instructions on how to achieve that to the mailing list
soon. Speaking of the mailing list, that will also change address but no one
need re-subscribe: we can transfer the subscriptions over. Some of us will also
be working to update the wording on The Carpentries website and in our various
GitHub repositories. If you'd like to help with that effort, please give us a
shout on [this issue](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/issues/61).

Of course, it's a dangerous form of bureaucracy when a committee begins to take
all of its time discussing its own name instead of actually _doing things_!
With that in mind, I'd like us to move quickly through this process and get back
to what we're most interested in: supporting our instructor community. Our
meetings take place on _the third Monday of every month at 13:00 & 22:00 UTC_
and are _open to everyone_.

At the next one, we will devote a large chunk of the time to collect ideas for
projects and activities that would support the development of Carpentries
community members. If that sounds interesting to you, _you are warmly
encouraged to join us_. You can find connection details on [our etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/scf-mentoring).
I hope you choose to join the discussion and help us make this community even
better.

To finish, a brief word about The Carpentries Mentoring Groups Program,
which is about to enter another round. Although I couldn't commit the time to
be a mentor in the previous round, I attended the [Virtual Showcase](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/08/sign-up-mentoring/) last week,
where mentors and mentees described the progress that they'd made with their
group and the positive effect that it had had on them. I was struck by the
enthusiasm of the participants and the frequent mentions made by mentees of how
being part of the program had built their confidence. At the beginning of each
round, mentees are encouraged to set [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) targets but it seemed to me that
the positive impact that the mentors and other group members had had on one
another would reach beyond these specific goals.

Inspired by this, I've applied to be a mentor again in the next round and there's
still time for you to apply to be a mentor or a mentee too: applications
close on 31 August. To get involved, see the [information pages](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/tree/master/mentoring-groups).
