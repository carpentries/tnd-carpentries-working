As announced two weeks ago, the Executive Council has been working on developing
drafts of the mission and vision statements for the new joint
organization. These drafts are now available and we request your feedback
through two Requests for Comment and related GitHub issues by midnight (in 
your time zone) Friday August 31, 2018.

Requests for Comment (RFCs, also called Requests for Public Comment) are a tool
used to solicit feedback on planned actions that affect a broad community. These
RFCs build on those used during the merging of Software and Data Carpentry to
ensure that these central guiding statements serve all members of our diverse
community.

Discussion on the two statements will happen separately using GitHub issues:

[Vision Statement](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/2) | 
[Mission Statement](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/1)

Feedback of any kind is encouraged, including specific ideas for changes,
concerns about particular language, and support for both the drafted language
and proposed changes. We want to make sure that the words and ideas in these
statements are inclusive to all and so actively encourage comments from members
of underrepresented groups including people of color, members of the LGTBQ
community, first generation students, and people for whom English is not their
first language.
