A few weeks ago, the Executive Council [announced](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/07/ec-rfc-overview/) 
an RFC for bylaws for The Carpentries. Bylaws traditionally describe the rules 
and regulations used to run an organization. As a fiscally sponsored organization, 
The Carpentries is not required to have formal (legally binding) bylaws. As an 
organization that is community-driven, though, these bylaws are important for 
describing the role of the community in governing and guiding the strategic 
direction of The Carpentries. We have tried to use plain language, rather than 
legal jargon, to make the document accessible for our diverse community members, 
while still attempting to provide clear expectations associated with the 
structure and governance of The Carpentries. 

We welcome any comments or concerns noted by the broader community as we 
continue developing The Carpentries. Please head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/2018_Bylaws) to read the draft, add 
comments or create new issues. We will leave the repository open to comments 
until September 14, 2018 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth), after which the 
Executive Committee will revise and vote on the final version. Thank you in 
advance for your efforts to help form a cohesive and inclusive community!
