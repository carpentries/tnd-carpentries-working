[CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin is little more than a month away! This inaugural community-building 
and networking event for The Carpentries should be a major highlight
of the year, with a great [program](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#prog) of speakers and workshops to keep people engaged. 
CarpentryCon will run from 30 May to 1 June, 2018.

To help people get excited about what is coming, the Task Force are running a daily Twitter countdown 
through the [dedicated CarpentryCon feed](https://twitter.com/carpentrycon). You can also join an upcoming community call where members of the Task Force will answer any questions you might have. There will be two calls you can join, both on 3 or 4 May, depending on your time zone. 

- *First call*: 13:00 GMT/UTC [see time in your zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CarpentryCon+Call&iso=20180503T13&p1=%3A&ah=1)
- *Second call*: 19:00 GMT/UTC / 12 noon PDT [see time in your zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CarpentryCon+Call&iso=20180503T12&p1=234&ah=1)

Sign up for either call on the [CarpentryCon etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/carpconcall). All welcome. Post questions in advance if you
are unable to attend. We will post the answers.

[Malvika Sharan](https://twitter.com/MalvikaSharan/), a leading member of 
the [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon) has produced a new poster 
for CarpentryCon 2018. It lists our keynote speakers and provides a ton of useful information.
