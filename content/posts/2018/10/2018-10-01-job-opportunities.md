The Carpentries is searching for two new full-time staff members to join our global, mission-driven organisation. These new roles will work with and serve our volunteer community - comprised of our 35,000 learners, 1,500 Instructors, 70 Trainers, and 75 member organisations from research institutions around the world. 

Our new Community Engagement Lead will oversee The Carpentries’ efforts to develop and support our global, inclusive community - creating pathways for participation and increased communication. They will be key in developing strategies and support for local community leaders and Carpentries Champions and support our global community. They will disseminate updates about our projects and activities to diverse communities via blog posts, Twitter, and related outlets and engage with the community on discussion forums and through meetings.

Our new Administrative Support Specialist will process payments for memberships and workshops, produce financial reports, record financial and workshop data, and serve as liaison in communicating with our fiscal sponsor, collaborating organisations, and clients on administrative matters.

Both new staff members will join a diverse and engaged team of professionals working to spread data-driven research skills around the world. Both of these positions are remote, with some travel requirements. We encourage applications from qualified applicants without regard to location.
