In 2016, Software Carpentry gave
Christina Koch,
Adrianna Pinska
and
Jon Pipitone
the Community Service Award for their [valuable contributions](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/12/community-service-awards.html) to the project.
In 2017, [Anelda van der Walt received the award](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/12/csa-award-avdw).
This year,
with the merger of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
to create the umbrella project known as The Carpentries,
the Executive Council decided to continue with the recognition
of extra hard work by some volunteers
and will choose and announce 2018 award winners in December.
