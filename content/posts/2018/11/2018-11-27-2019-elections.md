The Carpentries will hold an election from December 3-7 for both the 2019 Executive Council as well as The Carpentries’ 
vision.

The Carpentries Executive Council is hosting two Community Calls this week (on Thursday/Friday depending on your time zone) to 
discuss the election. Two sessions will be held to accommodate our global community. Connection details are in the 
[etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-call-2018-11-29); please sign in if you plan to attend. These community calls 
will provide an opportunity to ask questions about community governance and the election process, as well as learn more about 
the candidates for the community-elected Executive Council positions. 

### On the Ballot

The Carpentries holds annual elections to select the two community-elected Executive Council positions open each year. For an 
overview of the responsibilities of the Executive Council and governance in general, please see 
[this blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/10/ec-elections/). The candidates for the 2019 community-elected 
Executive Council positions are:

* [Elizabeth Wickes](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/11/wickes/)
* [Amy Hodge](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/11/amyhodge/)
* [Juliane Schneider](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/11/juliane_schneider/)

The ballot this year will also include three options for the new vision of The Carpentries, as refined following feedback from 
the [RFC](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/2):

* Data and computing skills for everyone
* Building communities teaching universal data literacy
* Empowering everyone to solve problems using data

### Ballot Logistics
