Belinda Weaver has been the Community and Communications Lead first with Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry and then with The Carpentries for over a year, and has been a long time community member, Mentor, Instructor, Trainer, Software Carpentry Steering Committee member and champion. She helped found Library Carpentry, which creates a bridge between libraries and The Carpentries, and organised three annual global Mozilla sprints for Library Carpentry from 2016-2018. She was a lead on our inaugural CarpentryCon, and has taught one of the highest number of workshops of anyone in our community (43!). She’s refreshed our newsletter (taking it twice-monthly and adding great content) and built and maintains The Carpentries website, so we know that many of you have met, worked with, read the writings of, and learned from Belinda.

Belinda is now taking on new challenges and leaving employment with The Carpentries (but not its spirit!), to take a new position as Manager, Library Academic Engagement at Griffith University in Brisbane. There she will be able to put into practice many of the ideas she has about how universities can pivot to train people for research. We are going to miss having Belinda with staff, but are excited for her and her new role, and glad she’ll still be working to build capacity for training in data and software skills. 

Belinda’s last day with The Carpentries will be Friday, 5 October. Please join us in saying thank you to Belinda for all the work that she’s done and the enthusiasm and Australian sayings (not to mention the CarpentryCon icebreaker featuring Australian animals) she’s brought to the community. 

Communications and community are core to The Carpentries, so we will be immediately posting a new position. Keep your eye out for that coming up next week, and please help spread the word through your networks. 

Thank you Belinda!
