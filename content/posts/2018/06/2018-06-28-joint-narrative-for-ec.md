Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged officially on 1 January 2018 to form a new 
organisation, [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). In mid-June, The Carpentries held  their 
first [Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/) in-person meeting. 
A report of that meeting will be published shortly. 

In preparation for the EC meeting, Carpentries' staff prepared a narrative report on the progress we have made 
as a joint organisation since we began to work together more closely from January 2017. 
Two key milestones during that time were the creation and launch 
of both [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/) and the new Carpentries [website](https://carpentries.org/).

See our report: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1294080](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1294080)

We wanted to provide an overview of what we have jointly achieved and provide an update on the status of our 
various programs. The report complements 
the [programmatic assessment work](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/programmatic-assessment/) 
recently compiled and published by our Program Manager, Maneesha Sane.

This report summarises work from January 2017 to March 2018. It covers workshop administration, 
assessment, instructor training, curriculum development and maintenance, community engagement and 
volunteer management, and communications. If you want to get a broad overview of what is happening in The 
Carpentries, this is the place to start!

The report is published on Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1294080](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1294080)

Stay tuned for a report from the EC meeting. This report will appear on
The Carpentries [blog](https://carpentries.org/blog), and a link to it will also be 
shared via our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries), 
our [Facebook](https://facebook.com/carpentries) page, and 
our [mailing lists](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/). 

We welcome your feedback.
