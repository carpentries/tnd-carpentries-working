### Carpentries Listens

"You Belong in The Carpentries"

The Carpentries is a community organisation, and we want to [hear from our community](https://carpentries.org/carpentrieslistens/).

As a part of developing Mission and Vision for The Carpentries, we, the staff and The Executive Council, are 
embarking on a virtual listening tour. Starting at CarpentryCon 2018 on May 30, 2018 and running until June 14, 2018, 
we’ll ask our community some short questions. You can respond via 
Twitter ([Tweet to @thecarpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries)) or, if you prefer to be anonymous, you 
can answer through a [survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/EpISXB) where you do not have to identify yourself. 

There are four themes:

- Learning
- Growth
- Community
- Gratitude 

Every few days, we’ll post a new question, 
and ask for your responses. We are here not to respond, but to listen.
The idea of the listening tour is that _we_ hear from _you_, and we want to hear from everyone! It doesn’t matter if 
you’ve taught a ton of workshops or are just hearing about The Carpentries for the first time, we want you to know 
that *you belong in The Carpentries*.

We want to hear what you think and feel about [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and also what you think about where we 
should go from here.

We generally won’t be responding - we won’t reply or retweet because we plan to be listening. We want to hear what 
you have to say, what you like, and we want to see what you retweet. We’ll summarise the conversations 
as we go and at the end of the virtual tour.

Over the next two weeks we’ll post questions [here](https://carpentries.org/carpentrieslistens/). We can’t wait to listen!

#### Learning

Our first theme is **Learning**.

- What is one thing _you_ have learned with The Carpentries?
- What is one thing you are still confused about or wish you knew?
