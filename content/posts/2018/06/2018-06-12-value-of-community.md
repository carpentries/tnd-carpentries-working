[Belinda Weaver has already given a great overview of CarpentryCon](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/carpentry-con-report/),
praising both the program and the atmosphere of the conference. One of the
most important lessons that I learned during the conference was how great it is
to keep quiet and hear someone else say what I think (yes, it took me 33 years
to learn this), so I'll try not to repeat much of what she already said so well.
I would like to echo her praise of the organising committee though, and applaud
their determination to provide assistance with travel costs. It was wonderful to
see the global Carpentries community so well represented at our inaugural
conference.

Community is a word that you'll read a lot in this blogpost. Since I first
started to dabble in computing ten years ago, I've tried to get
involved in several open source projects. The Carpentries is the first one that
"stuck" and it was the community of people involved that made the difference for
me. Joining my first instructor discussion sessions, I was struck by what I consider
to be the defining characteristics of Carpentries' community members: positivity,
optimism, enthusiasm, and altruism. Sure, there's a wealth of talent and technical
knowledge within our community, but it's the determination for self-improvement,
to help other people, and to discuss and overcome obstacles to learning, that
made The Carpentries stand out to me. Or, as someone else put it during the
closing Q&A session at the conference, we are a community of

> "Nerdy people who want to help others."

I got excited about the prospect of CarpentryCon from the first time that I
heard about it, back in 2016. Most of that excitement stemmed from the potential
to meet so many of the inspiring folks that I'd met online, or whose name I knew from
Twitter, threads on our Discuss mailing list, and so on. Sure enough, one of the
highlights of last week was meeting so many of these people in the flesh.
But once that initial rush was over, I was delighted to discover that the rest
of the conference had so much more to offer me. Several of the skill-up and breakout
sessions were extremely useful - stay tuned for my write-ups of Francois'
breakout on lesson infrastructure, and the session that Kari and I ran on
mentoring.

But I particularly want to talk about community building. We had a whole
breakout session devoted to the topic, run by Belinda Weaver and Malvika Sharan.
Even with the help of Belinda's "talking stick"\*, we still didn't have time to
discuss everything that people had to contribute to the session, but we touched
on the value of regular local meetups e.g. [Hacky Hours](https://hackyhour.github.io/),  [ResBaz](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/),
[Mozilla Science Lab Study Groups](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups), and the
[the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/),
and the existence of the [Carpentries' Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/introduction/00-index.html#building-or-improving-your-own-local-community),
which is not as disturbing as the name might make it sound ;)
If you know of other programs and resources that might be relevant, contributions to the Cookbook are welcome!

Beyond that dedicated breakout, so much of the conference was about building and expanding
our community: from the Australian Marsupials (plus one reptile) Story Circle,
through "thank you" and "ask/offer" sticky note activities, to the many connections made
in individual and group conversations enabled by intentionally long coffee and
lunch breaks. This all worked to ensure that, rather than being an event only
for the "hard core" of the established community, CarpentryCon was a welcoming
and useful event for newcomers too. I like to think that this is a reflection of our community as a whole.

In a world that seems to bend increasingly towards the interests of privileged
groups and individuals, I find inspiration in the positivity and supportiveness of my
discussions with Carpentries community members. CarpentryCon was no exception to
this: three full days of genuine and encouraging interaction with like-minded
people who want to make a difference by using their expertise to benefit others.
I left Dublin feeling reinvigorated and inspired to work harder to bring this
spirit into the rest of my life.

I hope you'll forgive me if I finish with a pitch, to those of you who work in community building or are interested in
the topic. You're warmly invited to join a series of community calls that a group of
us are setting up, [based on discussions that began at the RSE conference in Manchester in 2017](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2018-05-11-building-communities-support-research-software-engineering-blog-series-33).
These calls will provide an opportunity to share
experience and resources around community building, so that we can all benefit
from what others have learned and tried in this area. Each will begin with
discussion around a specific topic, followed by an opportunity for more general
discussion. Our first session, focussing on connecting geographically isolated
community members, will take place at 14:00 UTC on Thursday 14th June 2018.

Thanks for reading. I look forward to seeing you all at the next CarpentryCon! :)
