Individual control and transparency are core Carpentries' principles, and we have gone through an evaluation of our privacy policy to 
update it for the merged Carpentries organisation as well as for the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR).

We want to share updates in the [privacy policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/privacy.html) and use this 
as an opportunity for Instructors to update their records and opt-in to being included on our [new website](https://carpentries.org/). 

### Updating Instructor records and being added to The Carpentries Instructor website

With the move to our [new website](https://carpentries.org/), we want to provide an updated list of Instructors. Instructors who 
opt-in will be included on the website. To protect privacy, any Instructor who does NOT opt-in will not be listed. We've added 
a 'consent to publish profile' checkbox to Instructor profiles, and we'll use that information to update the Instructor list 
on our website.

We use some of the information you provide in our lesson release. To associate your contributions on our lessons with your research 
papers, we encourage you to provide us with your ORCID identifier. If you do not already have one, 
consider [creating one](https://orcid.org/register), it only takes a few seconds and helps you get credit for all 
your research, software/code contributions and these curriculum products.

Have you moved since our records were last updated? Check your Instructor profile, and update your 
location (and possibly your email contact details). As we start to build more regional communities, there 
will be opt-in options to help you better connect with your local community.

### Privacy policy updates

[Updated Privacy Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/privacy.html)

We updated our privacy policy to make it more clear and concise, with sections on the different ways that people currently 
interact with our community, whether in-person or online. Each section includes both 'What information do we collect?' 
and 'How do we use the information?' sections. We also include explicit information on how you can be removed from our database 
if you want to be removed. We have also updated the security settings in our database to reflect current practices. 

As always, please [contact us](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if you have questions about The Carpentries and your data privacy, 
and thank you for being a part of the community!
