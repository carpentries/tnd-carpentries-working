Calling all learners! If you've taken a Software, Data, or Library Carpentry workshop in the past six months, I want to hear from you!

I would like to know what has transpired in your work and career since you completed that workshop. Have you changed what you do? 
Begun to work more efficiently? Passed on skills to others? Or perhaps you have gone on to learn other things, or to learn more about the skills
you picked up.

Whatever the change, I want to know about it. 

Please complete our [Long-Term Impact Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/carpentrieslongtermassessment). 
It will not take long, and your feedback will help The Carpentries 
understand whether our workshops are helping you achieve the skills you need to work efficiently, effectively, and 
reproducibly with data.

I am planning to release the results of this survey during 
the **State of The Carpentries** presentation at [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/)! I will follow that up with a blog post.

Not sure what the survey is all about? 
You can check out the [first long-term impact report](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/long-term-survey-results/).

Thank you so much for your continued support and involvement with The Carpentries.

Why not fill in the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/carpentrieslongtermassessment) today?
