On 3-5 July, Macquarie University hosted the [2018 Sydney Research
Bazaar]( https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/sydney/) (ResBaz). Macquarie University became a member organisation of The Carpentries, joining in 2016 as the first supporting member organisation in Australia. Associate Professor Shawn Ross, Director of Data Science and eResearch at Macquarie, welcomed attendees to the event.

Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting digital literacy emerging at
the centre of modern research. Every year, ResBaz events are held at university
campuses across the globe. The aim of these events is to equip researchers from all
career stages with digital skills and tools to make their research faster and smarter.

A unique blend of academic and social life, ResBaz is an event unlike any academic
conference.

ResBazzes were held this year in [eight other
locations]( https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/): three in New Zealand ([Dunedin](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/07/resbaz-dunedin/),
Auckland, and Wellington), three others in Australia (Brisbane, Melbourne, and Perth),
as well as Tucson, Arizona in the US and Oslo in Norway. 

This year's Sydney ResBaz included two days of workshops and digital skills sessions.
Training in Python [Software Carpentry]( https://software-carpentry.org ) , [Data Carpentry
with R](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop), SQL and Data
Manipulation were offered to participants. It also premiered a Humanities, Arts and
Social Sciences (HASS) Mixed stream.

The third, "festival" day featured social activities, lightning talks, demonstrations, booths
and stalls, and sessions on machine learning, LEAN innovation, and a digital humanities
THATCamp [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org/) -(The Humanities and Technology Camp)
Unconference.

Word about Sydney ResBaz spread quickly soon after registrations opened in late May,
with upwards of 600 people registering or waitlisting. From these, over 350 people
attended, making it the largest Sydney ResBaz to date with a reach expanding to
regional NSW and Canberra. 

Sydney ResBaz 2018 was a joint effort of the University of
New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the University of Technology Sydney,
Western Sydney University, the University of New England, and Macquarie University.

The support of several more universities (including University of Newcastle and the
Australian Catholic University) and the participation of partner organisations - Intersect,
AARNet, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, CSIRO, ARDC, PC Lab Archives,
Overleaf, Clarivate Analytics, and Microsoft â€“ have allowed Sydney ResBaz to grow in 2018.
