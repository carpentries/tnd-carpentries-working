In January 2018, The Carpentries was formed as a unifying organisation for Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry and other lesson programs. Over time,  we have built awareness for foundational coding and data science skills through our workshops, instructor training program, and community events, but we have not yet made clear our vision - What type of organisation do we want to be? Who and what do we represent? Our vision is more than just a statement; it spells out where we see The Carpentries in the future and guides our decision making and priorities in the present. Over the past two years we have [developed](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tff7a58a2ba038c66-M6e898143b16a8774fe26482b/sharing-carpentries-style-lessons-with-the-community) [programs](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/transition-to-typeform/) and grown as a community. Today, thanks to everyone’s work co-creating these messages through conversations, discussions, and [requests for comments](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/08/mission-vision-rfc/), we are proud to release our vision statement.

**The Carpentries’ vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching computing and data skills.** 

## We Are Never Finished 

We are never finished. Our vision drives us as a community and inspires our learning and actions. We know that wherever we are, there is more that we can and should do, and that we have a responsibility and opportunity to connect, listen, learn, do and help each other. 

Because our task is never finished, we must work sustainably to  support each other in our efforts toward fulfilling our mission and vision and to continue to value each other as people first. We all came to the Carpentries community via different paths; this network of paths connects us, makes us stronger, and enables us to achieve more toward our vision of the world. We are not there yet, but we can commit as a community to who we are and where we want to be, and then work together to achieve these goals.. 

Stating our vision is only the beginning of this work. The [community has been contributing](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/carpentries-values-update-and-question-three/) to the development of our Value statements, important work that is an essential part of working towards our vision. We will be releasing The Carpentries Value statements soon and expound what they mean to us as a community. 

Thank you to everyone who contributed to these efforts in big, small, visible and less visible ways.
