[Our long-term survey](https://zenodo.org/record/1402200#.Xc780y3MxhF) was developed to collect information from learners at least six months after completing a Carpentries workshop. To date, we have received 633 responses to our long-term survey between March 2017 and September 2019. We are officially opening our [Long-Term Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/carpentrieslongtermassessment) and would like anyone who has taken a Data, Software, or Library Carpentry workshop between April 2018 and December 2019 to provide feedback by completing the survey.

In the first quarter of 2020 we will be releasing learner assessment infographics. We look forward to learning about and sharing the results of our long-term survey and our short-term (pre- and post-workshop) surveys. 

We will collect long-term survey results until 20 December 2019, so please share the survey in your Carpentries networks. Our goal is to collect at least 100 responses. We want to hear from our learners about their experiences and ongoing involvement in The Carpentries.

Interested in our assessment resources? You will find all of our surveys and reports on the [assessment-repo](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment). [Get in touch](mailto:team@carpentries.org) to get involved with assessment at The Carpentries!
