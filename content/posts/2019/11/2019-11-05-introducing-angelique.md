## Message from Dr. Angelique Trusler

I am truly thrilled to be joining The Carpentries team in the capacity of Regional Consultant for Southern Africa. 
I am based in Johannesburg, South Africa and have been part of The Carpentries community since 2017 as an Instructor.
As a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Optentia Research Focus Area, North-West University, South Africa (2015-2018), 
I investigated the social-ecological contributions to youth resilience across five countries 
(Canada, Colombia, China, New Zealand, and South Africa). We found that within South Africa education 
is a cornerstone in supporting young people at-risk in doing well. 
The aforementioned, together with my involvement in The Carpentries resulted in various knowledge dissemination 
and transfer activities including workshops in basic programming skills as well as course material in the biannual 
Optentia Short Learning Program in Methodology; where I am also an Extraordinary Researcher.  

My passion lies in empowering scholars, young and old, with the necessary skills to conduct efficient, 
open and reproducible research – The Carpentries is a great platform to take on this challenge.
