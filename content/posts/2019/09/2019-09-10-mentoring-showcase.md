### Have you ever been curious about what happens in a Carpentries Mentoring Group?

The Instructor Development Committee will be hosting its first Mentoring Virtual Showcase for the 2019-2020! The showcase will take place on October 15, 2019 at [19:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Mentoring+Virtual+Showcase&iso=20191015T19&p1=1440&ah=1). During the showcase, current mentors and mentees will share progress on their projects, how they've grown, and how you can get involved. Come and see presentations from the mentoring groups who met over the summer to get an idea of what possibilities there are, whether you're a future mentor, mentee, or enthusiast!

Three mentoring groups will present about their projects involving lesson maintenance, teaching Carpentries material, and organising a workshop. This event is a low-pressure way to see if being a mentor or a mentee is right for you.
