The Executive Council is the governing body of The Carpentries responsible for its strategy and sustainability. As a community council, they are the true stewards of the organisation, guiding the project, listening to, reflecting on and making decisions on behalf of the community. That is a big responsibility! 

The Carpentries Executive Council established in 2018 with the formation of the project. From the onset, it had community-elected and council-elected positions to both represent the community and ensure a set of diverse perspectives and skills necessary for the functioning of this council. 

Previously, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry had Steering Committees and Library Carpentry had a governance group who provided the same function, guiding those projects in strategy and planning for sustainability, based on the Software Carpentry Foundation’s [original governance model](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/12/scf-governance.html).

Through the years, all of these governance groups have had extremely committed people who volunteered their time to literally keep these projects going, doing everything from looking for funding, to creating bylaws, to managing Executive Directors, and encouraging and supporting so many in our community and team who do the day to day work. They are the true stewards of the organisation, which is saying a lot [in an organisation whose values reflect the power and importance of stewardship as a way of leading](https://carpentries.org/values).

This year the Executive Council has achieved [some significant milestones with The Carpentries vision and community values, and a strong draft toward a strategic plan](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/ec-meeting-2019/). They developed Task Forces and adopted Requests for Comments (RFCs) as a way of working to both get feedback from the community and collaborate towards solutions. And now, [with our current voting](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/12/executive-council-elections-2020/), we are going through our third round of elections for this group. As an organisation, we are still young, and this group has been doing the work to define its [roles and responsibilities](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council) and embody our value of always learning. 

In addition to  decision making, taking part in regular discussions, sitting in for meetings and attending to GitHub issues, serving on the Executive Council is an opportunity to connect people from different places and communities and create community. The [Executive Council in-person meeting](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/ec-meeting-2019/) ice breaker this year had people organise themselves in order of their birthdays and without consultation for hints. There was the usual type of spread, but with 9 people, two actually had their birthday on the same day! Of course we had to pause and reflect on the birthday fallacy and calculate the statistics, so even an intro ice breaker brought together their love of data, analysis and community.

My role as Executive Director puts me in close proximity with the Executive Council's undertakings and I want to acknowledge and deeply thank all of [our current](https://carpentries.org/governance/) and past governance group members, those for The Carpentries now as well as those who have been on the Software, Data and Library Carpentry governance groups that have led to this.
