We have a deep appreciation for the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/) (CoCc). Though its main goal is _to maintain, update, and enforce The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC)_, this committee has contributed to instructor training material (pull requests [#950](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/pull/950) and [issue #897](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/897) , clarified overlapping responsibilities with core team members and the Executive Council, onboarded two new members (welcome [Ivo](https://github.com/arreyves) and [Benjamin](https://github.com/BenjaminSchwessinger)!) and finalised its governance structure.

Additionally, the committee contributed to recommendations for incidents that fall outside its mandate ([see recommendations](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/incidents-outside-cocc/2019-09-19-cocc-taskforce-summary-recommendations.md)), all while exhibiting our [core values](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/carpentries-values/). 

[The revision of the Code of Conduct and supporting documents](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/02/coc-documentation-release/) was a major project for the CoCc this year. Their work was particularly instrumental in helping us define our [incident response](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html) and [reporting guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-reporting.html). Involving a wider community in making decisions on handling reports that are from outside community spaces was a goal, priority, and challenge, and the committeeâ€™s approach resonated well with many in the community. The Code of Conduct committee acknowledges that, as our community evolves, they will need to continually revisit and revise our processes to ensure we are providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all people. 

We cannot thank these individuals enough for the countless emails and GitHub issue responses, swift and fair decision making, thoughtfulness, and collaborative approach to the work you do. The Code of Conduct committee faced several challenges this year, and as staff liaison working closely with the committee, I am proud of the work we did.
