Our [Etherpad instance](https://pad.carpentries.org) is a critical part of our infrastructure. Everyday, hundreds of community members use it to take notes during workshops, instructor trainings, and community calls.

On November 30th, we upgraded the server that runs our Etherpad instance to accommodate the growth of our community. In the process, we have also upgraded to the latest version of Etherpad and made a few visible changes.

You will notice that:

- we are using a new look that improves the lisibility of the content of the
  pads;
- it is now possible to have different headings and styles in your pads;
- the date at which a message has been posted in the chat window is now visible.


We hope these updates to our Etherpad instance will make your work and interactions with the Carpentries community better.

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
