### History

The origins of the [Trainer Community](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) as we know it today can be traced back to 2012 when [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) invited a handful of experienced [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) Instructors to improve their teaching skills as part of a [multi-week, online reading group and training course](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/08/what-we-cover-in-instructor-training.html). Within a year, about 50 instructors completed the course to become certified Software Carpentry Instructors.
In 2014, the first [3-day instructor training workshop](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/11/instructor-training-in-three-days.html) was hosted in Toronto, Canada. Transitioning the course from weeks to days didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as Greg hoped, but [Warren Code](https://twitter.com/warcode) provided a lot of valuable advice that was used to refine the material, and by the end of 2014, the instructor training curriculum had the basic structure that is used today ([1](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57571), [2](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.278229), [3](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3258398)). In 2015, [Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry began using the same curriculum to train new instructors](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2016/03/instructor-training-africa), and this set the stage for transforming the curricula to serve train all future Carpentries Instructors. At this point in time, the demand for workshops was rapidly increasing and it was clear that our community needed a process for [training new trainers](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/).

_142 people have contributed to the Instructor Training Curriculum since 2013! To view the full list of contributors, visit the Instructor Training repository under The Carpentries organisation on GitHub at <https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/graphs/contributors>_

In 2016, about a dozen people to become Certified Trainers, and many of them worked collaboratively during a [Bug BBQ](https://swcarpentry.github.io/SWC-bug-bbq/), organised by Fran√ßois Michonneau, to get the Instructor Training Curriculum ready for its first official release as a published lesson ([1](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57571 )). The trainer training combined with collaborative lesson development really set the stage for building a community of Trainers. In 2017, [Erin Becker and Maneesha Sane](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/01/moving-forward), and later [Karen Word](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/new-staff-intro.html), began growing and leading the Training community. In 2018 and 2019, [Karen Word, Christina Koch, and Rayna Harris](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/12/instructor-training-curriculum-updates/) served as maintainers of the curriculum and hosts of the popular monthly Trainer meetings were Trainers from all over the world meet to discuss all things related to organising Instructor Training workshops and building local communities. For 2020, you can look forward to seeing an addition of new leadership positions within the Trainer Community and a continued refinement of the Instructor Training curriculum to better suit the needs over our diverse, global communities.

_In 2017, we began listing the names of all Trainers in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/carpentries/trainers>. The list was updated in 2018 and 2019, so from the commit history, we were able to approximate the years of service from each Trainer._


### When and Where

The trainers meet virtually on the first Thursday of every month (and occasionally on the 3rd Thursdays), but many Trainers meet up in small groups throughout the year to plan and teach in-person and online Instructor Training workshops.  The Maintainers and leaders of the  Instructor Training Curriculum almost meet twice a month to 1) discuss Pull Requests (PRs) and Issues, 2) plan the monthly meetings for the Trainers, 3) and discuss business related to the Trainer Community. Most, if not all of the Trainers, wear multiple hats within the community, also serving as instructors, maintainers, mentors, and regional coordinators or sitting on a variety of committees and task forces. We are grateful for their contributions across the globe and across the organisation.
