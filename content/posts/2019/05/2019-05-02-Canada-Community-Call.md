Are you in Canada and interested in growing the Canadian Carpentries Community? Join us for a Community Discussion on May 22nd at [12:30pm Eastern](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Themed+Discussion+Session%3A+Constructing+the+Carpentries+Community+in+Canada&iso=20190522T1630&p1=1440&ah=1) to get this growth started. In this call youâ€™ll have the opportunity to connect with Canadian Carpentries community members and learn how to empower instructors to run more workshops in more locations across Canada. The [Canadian Regional Coordinators](https://carpentries.org/regions_ca/) (John Simpson and James DesJardins) will be on hand to give a summary of the workshops that are currently offered and to answer any questions about the process that might come up.  By the end of the call we hope to have a volunteer or two join us as we continue coordinating the growth of the Canadian Carpentries Instructor Community. Participants will leave with ideas they can implement in their local community for growth and development.

Be sure to sign up on the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) if you would like to be a part of this conversation.
