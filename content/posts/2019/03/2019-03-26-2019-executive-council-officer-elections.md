At its recent meeting on March 21, 2019, The Carpentries Executive Council elected officers for the current year and appointed a liaison to the Code of Conduct Committee. Congratulations to all of our new officials! You can learn a bit about each of them below. 

[The Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/#roles-and-responsibilities-of-the-executive-council) is the governance arm of The Carpentries and is responsible for strategic and organizational planning, selecting and evaluating the Executive Director, financial oversight of the organization, identifying revenue streams and resource allocation, approving and monitoring our programs and services, and enhancing our public image. The Carpentries Handbook has details about [the responsibilities](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#officers) of each of the Executive Council officers. 

Our new officers are looking forward to a challenging and exciting year of positioning The Carpentries for a sustainable future with long-term goals that meet the values and mission of the organization and our community.
