The Carpentries activities in Africa have been growing through exemplary volunteer work of the community and outstanding workshop coordination and community leadership from Anelda van der Walt. We are now looking to hire a Regional Coordinator to continue this work and support the community and workshops as activity in Africa grows. This position will join our team of Regional Coordinators - [read more about that group](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/03/regionalcoordinators/) and the work they do to support their regional communities.

We seek an engaged and collaborative individual who shares this vision for a full-time position as The Carpentries Regional Coordinator - Southern Africa. This position will be based in South Africa (preferably in Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Potchefstroom) and will lead growth of The Carpentries community across the African continent, with a focus on Southern Africa.

In this role, you’ll help The Carpentries support our volunteer instructor community and member organisations to increase our collective impact on researchers across the continent. In Africa, we have trained almost 200 instructors and have run nearly 100 workshops in 10 countries in the last 5 years. The interest in workshops and instructor training is growing rapidly.

You will lead our community engagement efforts to develop and support The Carpentries community in Southern Africa, creating pathways for
participation and increased communication. You will lead recruitment of new instructors and institutional members, drive The Carpentries’
awareness efforts in Southern Africa, mentor instructors, and coordinate workshops within the region. You may also assist with workshop
coordination in other regions of the continent, with support from The Carpentries Workshops and Logistics Manager. You will build and
strengthen local communities through engagement with user groups such as
[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) and [Python Africa](https://africa.python.org/en/). You will join a global team of
Regional Coordinators who manage workshop logistics, assist in communicating with hosts and instructors, respond to general workshop
inquiries, and support growth of their regional communities. You will be supported by The Carpentries Workshop and Logistics Manager and
will also work closely with The Carpentries Community Engagement Lead.

This person will join a diverse and engaged team of professionals working to spread data-driven research skills around the world. Ideally this position will be based in Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Potchefstroom, but remote is possible. Some travel is required.
