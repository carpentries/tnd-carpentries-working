We operate in a broader ecosystem of training in digital skills and do, in our lessons, provide recommendations to other 
training resources. The recommendations that we make should also be consistent with our organizational values. We had 
previously recommended DataCamp in our lessons, so we want to respond to the [recently-disclosed incident of sexual 
assault at DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community). References to DataCamp materials 
had previously been removed as we were made aware of the incident before it became public, and we noticed and removed a 
final instance this week. The Carpentries does not have any formal relationship with DataCamp, nor will we pursue any 
relationship while this incident remains unresolved. 

We also know that many of our community members have interacted with the company, either as course developers or by 
taking courses. In addition, the victim of the assault is a member of our community. We appreciate and support the 
stances that many of these people and others in our community have made. See Noam Rossâ€™ post [Do Not Take My DataCamp 
Course, There Must be Consequences for Sexual Assault](https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/) for a summary 
of the overall community response.

Our goal as The Carpentries is to build a community teaching software and data skills. We teach essential computing 
skills to thousands of people in the research and library community each year. 
Our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.code_of_conduct_url }}) governs all of our 
events, our team and online spaces. Sexual harassment is not tolerated at Carpentries events or online spaces by any 
member of the staff, leadership, or volunteer community, and 
our [enforcement manual](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html) lays out 
the procedures for handling such cases, including temporary / permanent suspension from participation in the 
organization. We are committed to continuing to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for learning in The Carpentries. 

Our [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), 
and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) lessons cover a range of foundational topics in 
data and computational science for people new to working with data and software. As a non-profit project, we always 
welcome new learners at our workshops, new instructors to teach the material, and new lesson developers and maintainers. 
See [our website](https://carpentries.org/) or get in touch with us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) 
for information on any of our programs. Additionally if you're interested in open education and community lessons in 
general, join our [Slack channel]({{site.slack_invite}}/) on #openeducation.
