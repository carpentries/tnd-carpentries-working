The Instructor Development Committee (originally the Mentoring Subcommittee) was established in 2015 to develop and maintain a mentorship program to support instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. The committee helps promote community-building and networking by providing virtual spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss strategies for overcoming challenges. Any Carpentries community member is welcome to join the Instructor Development Committee. You can find more information in the [Instructor Development section of our handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/index.html).

The Community Development team recently prioritised the setting up of a new Instructor Development Committee Leadership Team for the period starting in May 2019 and ending in May 2020. We put out a call for applications to Carpentries community members interested in serving on The Instructor Development Committee Leadership Team [on our blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/03/IDC-leadership-recruitment/) and [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/gy2neLFS7KE) in March 2019, hosted an interest meeting in one of our community discussions, and were elated [to have Toby Hodges write a blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/04/idc-reflection/) and attend the interest meeting to answer questions in his capacity as the outgoing Instructor Development Committee co-chair.

We are pleased to share that, following these calls, several instructors from The Carpentries community stepped up and agreed to serve in various capacities over the next year as members of the [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/index.html) Leadership Team. We asked them what inspired them to join the Instructor Development Committee and here's what they had to say:
