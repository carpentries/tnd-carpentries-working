The UCLA Library is pleased to announce a [call for proposals](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/) for 
[Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-252335-ols-22), a two-year (2023-2024) project 
funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Service (IMLS) to incentivize lesson authors to develop and refine seven lessons each year through 
two-year sequential summer workshops. This initial call is for lesson proposals to form the project's first-year cohort (2023). 

The project seeks to support continued skills development for librarians in open science by creating a librarian-focused curriculum. Led by the UCLA 
Library Data Science Center, the project will award each recipient (individual or group) with $5,000 for developing an open science lesson. Authors 
will design and refine lessons through summer workshops utilizing the [Carpentries Curriculum Development guidelines](https://cdh.carpentries.org/) and 
the [Collaborative Lesson Development Training program](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/) as frameworks for curriculum 
development. The program was designed by a [team at UCLA](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/#team), including the chair of the Library Carpentry 
Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC), Tim Dennis, and certified Carpentries instructor Zhiyuan Yao. Inspired by the Carpentries’ 
evidence-based teaching and learning model, the team will work closely to align new lessons with existing Carpentries’ lessons, and leverage the 
Carpentries’ technical 
infrastructure to create new open-source lessons on GitHub. In addition, a member of LC-CAC will serve on the project’s [Review Committee](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/#team) 
each year with an eye toward aligning new lesson proposals with the existing Carpentries curriculum. One potential project outcome will be a series of new 
lessons for possible integration with Software, Data, or Library Carpentry curricula. A broader goal of the project is for librarians to increase 
their aptitudes in the principles and practices of open science, so that they can provide instruction to researchers and better support faculty by 
advocating and teaching open and transparent techniques. 

The project team currently seeks lesson proposals intended for synchronous instruction settings. Lesson proposals should support in-person and virtual 
settings. The completed lesson is expected to be 90 minutes to 3 hours long. Proposals that use open resources, such as open-source tools and software, 
and resources that are broadly accessible to all, are strongly preferred. The deadline for submission is January 31st, 2023, and awards will be announced 
by April 30th, 2023. For more information, please see the full [call for proposals](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/cfp).

Each award recipient or group will receive $5,000 for developing a lesson (how recipients receive the award depends on each institution). Awarded lesson 
authors will also attend workshops in the Summer 2023 to develop the necessary skills to build lessons. No previous experience with the Carpentries is 
required, though Carpentries instructors are encouraged to apply. The UCLA Data Science Center will provide technical support for publishing the developed
lessons.
