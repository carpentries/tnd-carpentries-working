We are pleased to announce the results of the community and council elections for the 2023 Executive Council, which will assume responsibility of governance from the current Executive Council in February 2023.

# Incoming community-elected members

[Two candidates](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/11/carpentries-2023-executive-council-election-nominees/) stood for the community election held during the first week of December. Out of the 1,386 ballots distributed to Voting Members, 356 ballots were cast (25.7% turnout). The two candidates receiving the highest number of votes and joining the Executive Council for two-year terms as community-elected members are:

- Jannetta Steyn (Senior Research Software Engineer, Newcastle University in the United Kingdom)  
- Sarah Stevens (Data Science Facilitator, University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States)  

# Incoming council-elected members 

The Executive Council received recommendations for three individuals for the council-elected positions. Following assessment of each candidate for their suitability regarding the expertise needed (see [this blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections/)), the Executive Council elected the following three individuals:
