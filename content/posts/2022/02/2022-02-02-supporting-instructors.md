It has been a long wait, but the news is finally outâ€¦online workshops are here to stay! After two years of implementing workshops online, we know that there is a lot that goes into the planning and execution of these workshops. The Core Team will be making changes over the course of 2022 to make the online workshop process as easy as possible for all; hosts, Instructors, learners, and members of the Core Team. One of these changes is that **we will no longer distinguish between Experienced and Supporting Instructors**.

The Workshop Administration Team will still make sure that there is at least one veteran Instructor at each workshop, similar to the pre-COVID days. However, you will no longer have to add whether you are an Experienced Instructor or a Supporting Instructor when you sign up to teach. We will also continue to do our best to provide up to four instructors for a workshop, with two being guaranteed.

Online workshops would not be possible without all of YOU! Thank you for all of the feedback, ideas, practice, trial and error, and hard work you have put into making online workshops a success. We look forward to continuing to offer online workshops in 2022 and beyond!
