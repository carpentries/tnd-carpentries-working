In November [we announced](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/11/membership-pricing-update/) upcoming changes to our pricing for Centrally-Organised workshops, Instructor Training, and Memberships. The new pricing structure increases the flexibility of our Membership offerings, allowing Members to create service packages that will best serve their needs. Weâ€™ve also introduced geographically-tiered pricing, which will enable us to better serve organisations outside high-income countries. Lastly, we are starting a financial support program to offer support for organisations who are unable to pay our standard fees, irrespective of location.

Details about our current Membership and a la carte offerings can be found on our [Membership page](https://carpentries.org/membership/). Answers to frequently asked questions can be found on our [Membership FAQ](https://carpentries.org/member_faq/). Our team is ready to assist you in putting together the ideal Membership for your organisation and to answer any questions - please [contact us](mailto:membership@carpentries.org).
