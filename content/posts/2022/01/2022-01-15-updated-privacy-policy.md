We are pleased to announce the release our new [Privacy
Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/privacy.html). This
new version follows a more standard structure and spells out your rights and how
to exercise them under European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and the California Customer Privacy Act (CCPA). It also includes the
legal basis we use to process your personal information.

One thing that has not changed is our commitment to your privacy. We collect as
little data as possible, we do not (and never will) sell your data, and we
provide you with access to all the data we store about you directly from your
AMY profile.

As part of reviewing our practices, we have switched the analytics of our
websites to use [Matomo](https://matomo.org). With Matomo, the analytics data
belong to us.

Cookie consent banners hamper the user experience and we therefore decided to
only use strictly necessary cookies across all our sites, even if it means that
some of our analytics are not as accurate or detailed as it could be.
Additionally, we switched the commenting system on our websites from Disqus to
[utterances](https://utteranc.es). Utterances is an open source tool that uses
GitHub as a backend for storing comments. The first time you leave a comment,
you will need to authorize the utterances application to post on GitHub on your
behalf.

Our commitment to ensuring best practices in handling your personal information
does not stop here. We will continue to improve our systems and workflows to
ensure the data we store about you remains safe and that we continue to comply
with local and international privacy laws.

It is important that we have up-to-date information about you in our internal
database, AMY. To this end, we encourage you to log in to AMY and ensure that
your information is accurate. Our Handbook includes information on [how to
update your profile
information](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#accessing-and-updating-your-instructor-profile).
Make sure that your email address is up-to-date, as we will be introducing a new
system for Instructors to register their interest for teaching workshops in the
upcoming months that will use AMY. Having your current email address will be
needed for us to inform you of upcoming teaching opportunities.

When you log in to AMY, we will ask you to:
- consent to our new Privacy Policy;
- confirm that you are at least 16 years old, and;
- consent to the transfer of your data outside the European Economic Area (a
necessity for an international organization such as The Carpentries).

Along with the new Privacy Policy, we are also publishing our [Terms &
Conditions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/terms-and-conditions.html).
This document clarifies the expectations of users of our websites and services.

As always, do not hesitate to contact us at
[team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org), if you have trouble
accessing your AMY profile or if you have any questions.

We would like to thank [Metaverse Law](https://www.metaverselaw.com/). They
drafted these documents and helped us think through our data handling processes.
