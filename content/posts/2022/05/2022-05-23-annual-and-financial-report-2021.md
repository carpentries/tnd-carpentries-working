This past year’s Annual and Financial Reports are now available. The reports can be found on the [reports page](https://carpentries.org/reports/), The Carpentries’ central resource for all reports including yearly reports, grant reports, and assessment reports.

We hope you take the time to read these reports to see all the work that our Core Team and community have done in 2021.

## 2021 Annual Report
The Carpentries Annual Report is an effort to summarize the work done towards our mission in 2021. It is a crucial tool that helps us understand where the community and Core Team have devoted our time, while also helping us know where to focus our efforts in the next year. Additionally, the report provides an opportunity to reflect on where we have been and where we are going.

## 2021 Financial Report
The 2021 Financial Report outlines important financial data compiled over the past year, including quarterly financial reports, data on income and expenditures, and year-over-year financial comparisons. This report helps the Executive Council and Core Team evaluate how The Carpentries is performing financially, and informs how we can position The Carpentries for sustainability and continued support of our mission.
