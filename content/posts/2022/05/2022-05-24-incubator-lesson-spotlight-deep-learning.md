### Target Audience

The main audience of this lesson is considered to have an academic background at any level. More importantly, we expect them to know basics of statistics and machine learning to follow through with the material.

## Lesson Progress

The lesson is currently in beta stage, which means the main content is there but there is room for fine tuning. It has been taught several times by the lesson authors, and a few times by others. We work actively on addressing issues and pull requests from beta teachers.
