The Carpentries is preparing to onboard a new cohort of Maintainers! We currently have 72 Maintainers serving across 48 official lessons. To maintain healthy support for all of our lessons, and to enable Maintainers to step back from the role as needed, we are recruiting an additional 52 Maintainers for 29 lessons. Although we are not yet able to hold Maintainer Onboarding in languages other than English, we strongly encourage applications from folks interested in maintaining one of the four official Carpentries lessons currently offered in Spanish.

You do not need to be a Git expert to be a Maintainer. If you are familiar with the current [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/) or [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) Git lessons, you will have the foundation and support to learn [the skills you will need as a Maintainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWhSYBkZJ0). The Maintainer community has a dedicated Slack channel, TopicBox list, and two monthly meetings to help
support you and the lesson you are working on.

For the first time, Maintainer Onboarding will be offered through both synchronous and asynchronous options. If you are able to participate synchronously, that option is highly recommended, as it will help you build connections with the rest of the Maintainer community. Please indicate in your application which option you plan to participate through.

If you are interested in helping maintain, improve, and grow our lessons, please
