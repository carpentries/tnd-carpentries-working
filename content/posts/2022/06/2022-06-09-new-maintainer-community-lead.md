Hi everyone,

My name is Vini and I’m excited to announce that I’ll be joining The Carpentries as Maintainer Community Lead. It’s a pleasure to assume this role passed on from [Daniel Chen](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/11/introducing-Dan-Chen-as-Maintainer-Community-Lead/), which did a wonderful job for the [past year and a half](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/05/community_maintainer_update/). The Maintainer Community Lead is a point of contact for all things related to maintenance of Carpentries lessons. I’ll also be hosting the monthly Maintainer Meetings that serve as a space to discuss that. You are welcome to ask any technical questions related to Git, GitHub, interacting with contributors or anything of the sort. Maintainers are a vital part of The Carpentries community, and we understand that being one requires a fair amount of time and commitment. So, we hope to support not only current Maintainers, but also to facilitate the process for people that would like to either step down from or return to their Maintainer role. I’m also very excited for this year’s round of Maintainer Onboarding, which is happening this week! Looking forward to meeting all of you joining.
**An important note:** due to time zone differences, starting from June the monthly Maintainer Meetings will change times to [12](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Monthly+Meeting&iso=20220615T12) and [22 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Monthly+Meeting&iso=20220615T22). For meeting times,  you can always check the [Maintainers’ CodiMD](https://codimd.carpentries.org/maintainers).


## About myself
I’m a graduate student at the University of Melbourne doing research in bioinformatics, and I’m really passionate about open source and research software. I worked on the [PSF Python Curriculum project](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/04/carpentries-python-software-working-group-grant/) last year, which [I wrote about in The Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/07/carpentries-python-curriculum-project-wrap-up/); that was a great opportunity to become more involved with The Carpentries community. I have a few years of experience with open source development, and I’m currently a Maintainer for the Python Ecology lesson in Spanish. My programming experience is mostly with Python but I do dabble in R occasionally. You can find me on GitHub as [@vinisalazar](https://github.com/vinisalazar/), or on The Carpentries Slack.
