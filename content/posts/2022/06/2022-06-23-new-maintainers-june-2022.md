We are pleased to announce that our most recent cohort of Lesson Maintainers have completed onboarding and are ready to support lessons across The Carpentries curricula. Thirty new Maintainers participated in the three hour [onboarding](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/), with the following goals:

- Orientation to The Carpentries goals and vision for lesson maintenance.
- Getting connected with other Maintainers and the overall Maintainer community.
- Developing skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors.
- Becoming familiar with the key components of the lesson template.
- Practicing core technical skills for lesson maintenance.
- Learning how and when to elevate issues to the Curriculum Advisory Committee.

We are excited to welcome these new members to the Maintainer community and look forward to working with them, and continuing to work with our many committed continuing Maintainers, over the coming months. If you are interested in becoming a Maintainer in the future, stay tuned for announcements of our yearly Maintainer Onboarding sessions.
