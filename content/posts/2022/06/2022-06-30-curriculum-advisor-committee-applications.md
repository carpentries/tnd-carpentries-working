_This post was updated on 12 July 2022 to indicate that we are also recruiting for new members to join the Curriculum Advisory Committee for Software Carpentry._

[In August 2021, we announced that The Carpentries is reactivating our Curriculum Advisory program](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/08/reactivating-curriculum-advisory-committees/). Curriculum Advisory Committees provide high-level oversight, vision, and leadership for a curriculum and guide large-scale updates. Each Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) supports and is supported by a group of Lesson Maintainers, who focus on day-to-day maintenance of the lessons. [In February 2022, we announced new CACs for Software Carpentry and three Data Carpentry curricula (Astronomy, Genomics, and Geospatial)](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/02/announcing-new-cacs/).

Today we begin the search for Curriculum Advisors for three more Data Carpentry curricula:

* [Data Carpentry: Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop)
* [Data Carpentry: Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-curriculum)
* [Data Carpentry: Image Processing with Python (currently in beta testing)](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#image-processing-curriculum)

**We are also hoping to recruit at least one more member to the Curriculum Advisory Committee for Software Carpentry**, to act as Secretary for that group - [read more about the committee roles in the community handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/curriculum_advisory_committees.html#roles-and-responsibilities).

Joining one of the Curriculum Advisory Committees (CACs) is an excellent opportunity to engage with The Carpentries and be directly involved with the development and leadership of our Curricula.

[The Carpentries Handbook includes more about what it means to be a Curriculum Advisor](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/curriculum_advisory_committees.html).

To ensure the accessibility of our lessons and curricula, we are seeking a diverse group of Curriculum Advisors, representing multiple career levels and sub-disciplines, and across a variety of geographic regions, and cultural and linguistic contexts. Each CAC should also include at least one active Maintainer, and we encourage applications from both new and experienced members of the Maintainer community.
