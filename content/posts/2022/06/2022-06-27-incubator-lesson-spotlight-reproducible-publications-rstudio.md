### Learning Objectives

* Get started with RStudio and learn about the advantages of using the environment in academic research and writing. 
* Build on research and analytical skills by learning how to create reproducible documents that combine code, analysis, and narrative.
* Understand good practices for project organization, version control, and documentation as means to advance open science. 
* Develop a reproducible paper with provided data, code, and narrative.

### Target Audience

Researchers, of any discipline and at any level, with interested in using Rstudio and learning good practices for reproducible research. 

## Lesson Progress

The lesson is fully developed and we have already taught it once at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for a cohort of approximately 25 learners. Based on our experience teaching the workshop, we have performed an additional round of review for all episodes and addressed a few things. Our lesson is currently in the last step of the alpha stage.
