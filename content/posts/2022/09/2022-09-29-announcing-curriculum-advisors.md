I am delighted to announce the formation of new Curriculum Advisory Committees
for [Data Carpentry Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop), [Data Carpentry Image Processing with Python](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#image-processing-curriculum), and [Data Carpentry Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-curriculum).
This follows [the Curriculum Advisory Committees (CACs) that were formed for many of our curricula earlier this year](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/02/announcing-new-cacs/), and means that we now have Curriculum Advisors providing guidance on all of The Carpentries lessons in English.
In addition to these new CACs for Data Carpentry, 
the CAC for Software Carpentry welcomes two new members.

Curriculum Advisory Committees provide high-level oversight, vision, and leadership for a curriculum and guide large-scale updates.

We put out 
[the call for volunteers to become Curriculum Advisors for these curricula](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/06/curriculum-advisor-committee-applications/)
in June, and 26 people applied.
19 of these people were invited to join Curriculum Advisor onboarding and
18 completed that onboarding last week.

CACs are a vital part of the ecosystem supporting our lessons 
and I am very grateful to the following people for volunteering to 
contribute their time and expertise in
support of the ongoing development of The Carpentries curricula.
