The long-awaited Data Carpentry curriculum for working with astronomical data is now available to teach! The [Foundations of Astronomical Data Science curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/astronomy-python/) was actively developed during the COVID-19 pandemic by the Astronomy Curriculum Data Carpentry Committee (ACDC; composed of Erin Becker, Azalee Bostroem, Allen Downey, Rodolfo Montez Jr., Brett Morris, and Phil Rosenfield) and has undergone The Carpentries incubation process including two alpha workshops and two beta workshops. The first official offering of the stable curriculum will be at the summer meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) this June in Pasadena, CA. This is the first new curriculum released by The Carpentries since August 2018 and represents the first curriculum designed for intermediate learners! The curriculum is now ready for any certified Instructor to teach! Keep reading to learn more.

## Whatâ€™s in the material?

This Python-based astronomy workshop introduces database-centric efficient astronomical research using databases of stellar motions and distances from the [Gaia space-based mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia), and photometric data from the [PanSTARRS project](https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/), to teach common database operations and data visualization. The curriculum offers foundational knowledge on the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL), which is an SQL-based database querying language with added utilities designed specifically for astronomical research, and open source Python packages (AstroPy, AstroQuery, and pandas). The curriculum guides a learner on building scalable database queries, working with data structures and storage formats, filtering data for discovery, and visualizing large data effectively and efficiently. The Foundations of Astronomical Data Science curriculum assumes prior knowledge of Python and some exposure to the Bash shell, equivalent to that learned in a Software Carpentry workshop. Find more information on [the curriculum homepage](https://datacarpentry.org/astronomy-python/).

## Want to teach this material?

An [onboarding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfaNFaKIOrY) and [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YosDXx1gBGpBxf6fCEaazFQwZ2dYTWgtYSdPEeD09yo/edit#slide=id.p) are available to help new Instructors teach these lessons. The onboarding material helps the Instructor with the material and covers the science concepts behind the research. Institutions interested in hosting a Foundations of Astronomical Data Science workshop can request a workshop using [this form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_workshop/).

## Curriculum background and next steps

The curriculum was developed through an American Institute of Physics (AIP) Venture Partnership Fund (VPF) award (PIs: Azalee Bostroem, Diane Frendak, and Rodolfo Montez Jr.) to the American Astronomical Society (AAS). You can learn more about the material and the alpha pilot workshops at [this previous blog pos](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/04/call-for-beta-applications-astronomy/)t. The workshop materials were initially piloted in alpha lessons held November 2020 and January 2021, then two beta workshops in July 2021 and November 2021.

The work of the ACDC will now be transferred to the Lesson Maintainers (Azalee Bostroem and Rodolfo Montez Jr.) and the newly formed [Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://carpentries.org/curriculum-advisors/) (CAC; composed of Heather Andrews, Azalee Bostroem, Adam Hughes, Rachel Lee McClure, Ivelina Momcheva, Brett Morris, Meredith Rawls, and Phil Rosenfield).

Thanks to all the community members who took part.
