## Summary

This June and July,
we will pilot a new program of _Collaborative Lesson Development Training_.
To apply to join the training, follow the link at the end of this post.


## About the Training

Aimed at groups of collaborators who want to start creating a new lesson,
Collaborative Lesson Development Training will focus on three main topics:

1. Good practice in lesson design and development
2. Creating lesson websites with The Carpentries Workbench
3. Collaboration skills

Spread over six half-days, with an extended break between sessions 4 & 5,
participants will learn 
how to prepare an effective lesson to suit a defined target audience,
how to implement that lesson as an open source website
using [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench-blogpost], and 
how to collaborate and build community around a lesson project. 

Participants will apply these principles 
as they are introduced during the training, 
creating a sound foundation for their lesson 
in a series of hands-on exercises, 
trialling newly-developed content, 
and preparing their lesson repository for collaboration.
### Planned Schedule

The pilot will be taught by
[Toby Hodges](https://github.com/tobyhodges),
[Aleksandra Nenadic](https://github.com/anenadic),
[Sarah Stevens](https://github.com/sstevens2),
and [Mateusz Kuzak](https://github.com/mkuzak).


## Who is the training for?

**The pilot is aimed at teams of 2-4 people who wish to collaborate on a new lesson.
At least one member of each team should be a certified Instructor**, 
having completed The Carpentries Instructor Training, 
or another training covering similar topics, e.g. RStudio Instructor Training.

Before joining the training, 
participants are expected to know how to 
write formatted text
(e.g. bold and italic, headings, links, bullet point and numbered lists) 
with Markdown, 
and be able to create and edit files with the GitHub web interface.


## Logistics

This training will take place virtually, 
combining video and screen sharing on Zoom 
with a collaborative notetaking document for sharing notes, 
responses to exercises, 
and links to further resources. 

**The first pilot will take place 12:00-16:00 UTC [13-16 June 2022][time-date-1] and [27&28 July 2022 (12:00-16:00 UTC)][time-date-2].**

There is no fee to join the pilot, but spaces are limited.
