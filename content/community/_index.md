## Community Overview

The Carpentries works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data analysis, computational thinking, and research software development through building local and global communities of practice.

We remain a nearly all-volunteer organisation. Our work is made possible by the efforts of our amazing volunteers, workshop hosts and organisers, community champions, member organisations, and Core Team (paid staff).
