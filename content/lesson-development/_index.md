## Collaborative Lesson Development Training

Collaborative Lesson Development Training teaches essential skills and good practices for designing and developing a lesson as an open source project. The training will guide you through the design process and initial development of a new lesson, prepare you to work with the infrastructure we use to build accessible, open source lesson websites, and provide some advice and techniques for effective collaboration on the project.

## About the training

### Target audience

Collaborative Lesson Development Training is aimed at Carpentries community members who have an idea for a new lesson and want to begin developing it into an open source lesson website, in collaboration with others. The curriculum was developed with a focus on lessons for short-format training (e.g. two-day workshops), but most of the skills and principles taught are applicable to all curriculum design.

### What will you learn?
The training teaches fundamental concepts, skills, and good practice in three key areas:

* Lesson design and development
* Collaboration
* Using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

- collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
- identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson
- define SMART learning objectives
- explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks
- create exercises for formative assessment
- explain how considerations of cognitive load should influence - the pacing, length, and organisation of a lesson
- use best practices to configure and maintain accessible and - usable lesson repositories that are readily available for collaboration
- identify and correct accessibility issues in a lesson built on The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
- use feedback and reflection from teaching to update and improve lesson material
- review and provide constructive feedback on lessons
